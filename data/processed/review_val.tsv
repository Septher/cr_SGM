Shipped fast, handled demanding games, and came with the listed specs: i5 7300HQ, GTX 1050 3GB, and 8GB Ram. I was very satisfied with how fast it shipped and how strong it is. I'd get more ram in the future but for now, these 8GB will be perfectly fine. I also love the build quality and the soft touch finish and this is also VERY easy to upgrade. 10/10 would buy again. This is worth the $800 for a cheap, strong gaming laptop.	3	7	3	3	0

Didn't realize it only comes with 32gb of in bedded hard drive space. Ran out of space real fast and had to buy an external 1T SSD. Also added an external DVD drive since it didn't have a built in one. I might have been smarter by purchasing a lap top that had all this with it. It works great now.	2	0	0	1	2

I purchased my laptop about 8 months ago. It has a couple of huge issues. First, every once in a while it will stop responding to any keys. It has to be hard shut down using the pin hole on the bottom. This has happened about 3 times since purchasing the computer. The second issue is that one of the speakers makes a loud static noise when the laptop starts to get warm. It happens really fast when you do any kind of VR or play games. It is too loud to keep playing.Acer Customer Service is worse than these issues. The agents are really hard to understand and Acer will force you to ship your laptop to them, AT YOUR EXPENSE, so they can work on it.I will never buy anything from Acer ever again.	4	7	5	8	0

I wanted a laptop for 2 purposes: 1) so I could browse the web quickly and stream videos and 2) so my husband could play games, even if at a lower quality, while we live abroad.It seems like my browser is constantly freezing (at least once per browsing session, but more times the longer I'm on, even if I'm just writing emails), and it is not an internet problem. I usually have to wait a full 2 minutes for the computer to function again. We have an older laptop (with worse graphics) that never freezes.For gaming, my husband turned the graphics all the way down on Overwatch. He says there's still a bit of a lag, making the game unplayable in competitive mode since the response time will mess up your ability to do well.	3	7	3	3	0

First time using an Asus. I purchased this immediately after returning the Dell Inspiron and after putting it through the same test (Monopoly on Pogo.com) the performance is much better. Feels like a business-quality laptop. I would appreciate a thinner laptop along the lines of an XPS or Zenbook, but at this price point Asus makes me feel like I got the better end of the deal.	3	6	2	8	3

Have now used this laptop for two months and can recommend it. Before buying it, you have to understand what you are purchasing...this is not a gaming computer or a laptop with high functionality. What it can do is provide a device that can deliver basic daily needs...email, streaming, surf the web, social media. I use this laptop mainly to watch Youtube, Twitch and even Netflix for movies for the simple fact that it is so light, I have no problem moving from room to room if needed...like when I decide to go cook...just get up and go. You can literally carry it with one hand no problem. Some have said it's slow...I have not encountered any speed issues. Not as fast as my other laptops but there isn't this huge lag problem. For example...youtube videos play straight on, even when you advance forward...it picks up at that point and goes. No problem with live stream videos either. Battery life is sufficient. Can watch several hours of vids.Biggest draw back of course is memory. But again you get what you pay for. You can add a dew things but don't expect this to hold your music library and/or media library and a multitude of extras. If you need a device to store...this is not for you. But if you need a secondary, or even third laptop to watch vids and social media etc...lightweight vs a full specced out laptop...and something that if dropped or stolen...you wouldn't feel too upset about because there is literally nothing on it of value because it's just for media consumption vs a work computer...this is a good laptop that runs a very familiar OS in Windows.UPDATE: May 22, 2018.....Definitely need external memory for Windows updates. Could have bought a 32gb USB but went ahead and bought a 250gb external hard drive just to have the space. The added $35 cost for HD brings total for this laptop to ~ $250. If purchasing...buy extra memory for it right away (or be prepared to use what you have already) and add that amount to your cost analysis when comparing vs other devices.	2	0	0	1	2
- Good-enough performance for, web browsing, emails, comparison shopping, light productivity (docs, sheets, slides).- Typing is okay, strong merits to its smooth metal curves around the entirety of the laptop (except below the ports). Feels wonderful beneath the palms.- 3:2 aspect ratio, offers a taller screen.**PlayStore (android apps), as of 08/07/2017,Beta as software term implies, are yet to perform as intended.For apps (you may experience occasional crashing and or screen freezing requiring power down to reset, problems may vary from device to device).YouTube app, download feature, with subscription, works.Chromebooks seem promising, optimistic of further improvements!**	1	1	0	1	4
"My 48 hours review of the New Microsoft Surface Laptop with my Pros and Cons...I originally planned on ordering my PC from Amazon but I ended up placing my order directly through the Microsoft Store and doing an in-store pick up. I was able to receive a 10% student discount so it made the price lower than anywhere else.I went with the Graphite Gold i5, 8gb, 256 - this configuration meets all of my needs since I don't do any gaming or do I run any heavy programs. My use will be web browsing, school and business use with Office 365, some light photoshop or camtasia every now and again, and streaming video so this compute meets all of my needs. I upgraded it to 10 Pro right out of the box since I don't want to be limited to Windows Store Apps only.The Alcantara wrapping is OK, I can see it getting very dirty and showing wear and aging at the 6 month mark, Microsoft says to just keep it clean by regularly wiping it downs using a damp lint free cloth. I personally will have this laptop connected to a docking station while at home and use a wireless keyboard and mouse along with a bigger monitor connected via hdmi from the mini display port so I am not that concern with it the Alcantara getting dirty and faded. I will only type on it directly when I am at school and I usually take hand written notes on legal pads so I'll make sure to keep it clean. Also with the Microsoft Complete for Surface Laptop you can get 2 yrs of coverage from damage and issues.Pros ++ The touch screen is excellent! The touch screen is really great and has works flawlessly so far.+ The screen and the resolution is excellent, the picture quality and brightness is the best of any computer I have owned and it should be as this has the highest resolution screen.+ The built quality feels premium and heavy with the aluminum casing.+ The Windows Hello Facial Recognition was a big selling point for me, it works great and you will have hands free sign-in.+ The speeds seems faster than the 15"" laptop I replaced which also had an i5 from an early generation at 3.2. That PC is still working perfectly I just wanted a new laptop.+ The keyboard is nice with 4 adjustable black light settings (off, low, med, high) and feel while typing is so quality and smooth.Cons -- The color could have been more vibrant with a bit more pop, I think I would have like the cobalt blue color better. But it is still a nice color.- The touch track pad sucks! Maybe I have to make some adjustments to it but so far it's too sensitive and responsive doing other things on its own I did not want.- Cost, it's a bit on the higher end. It is a premium product without a doubt so I guess you have to pay a little extra for that Microsoft quality. It's the same price as the 13"" Macbook Pro which I considered but ruled out because I prefer Windows.Another beautiful option to consider and the one I had to think about for a few weeks is the new HP SPECTER x360. That is a gorgeous computer with higher specifications for the same price. You can get a i7 a better graphics card and the same premium look and feel of quality with an aluminum body. The main reasons I decided on the Surface Laptop was the Windows Hello Face Recognition."	2	8	2	3	3
Works perfect. Great color on screen. Grand daughter love's it.	2	0	0	1	5
I bought this for my wife to replace her older, bulky, HP laptop. It was a few years old and replacement was due. She picked this one out at a retail store and we found it on Amazon for a reduced price. She LOVES it!! So light, fast, and cute because it's her favorite color. The palm rests have a cloth feeling but they are made of some plastic stuff that's easily cleaned, the screen looks great, and the keyboard feels right... partly due to the palm rests allowing a person to rest palms on them while typing. It has a fast hard drive, it's quiet and light. I really don't have negatives to say about it except that it only has a couple of USB 3 ports. That's OK... I bought a tiny USB 3 hub and we're all good now. Definitely recommend this device though it's not cheap.	2	7	2	3	3
This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!	3	7	3	8	4
"4.5 stars if there is such option.I can feel its power when I can use it even in a highly crowded subway train compartment. I turned it into a vertically held tablet, with many pre-loaded tabs opened. I can enjoy the online media contents almost anywhere. When I can sit down in restaurant, I turn it into a laptop doing the assignment or office works. Its versatility is impressive. ASUS Chromebook Flip serve similar purposes, but 10.1"" screen is really too small, and 1200 x 800 resolution is too low for me.(By the way, I rarely use tent mode and stand mode, which are not as good as laptop mode in my opinion. Even so, I think convertible laptop is far more convenient than detachable laptop. Quick and intuitive to transform.)110%+ sRGB, 380+nits... the screen surpass most other laptop/tablet touchscreens (although the new iPad Pro do even better in true-tone and anti-glare). But just keep in mind, if you find yourself rarely use touchscreen, you may find matte finish screen is more attractive to you.Cons:Short key travel, exceptionally small ""backspace"" button, non-backlit keyboard, inefficient use of space above the keyboard, non-movie-friendly 3:2 screen... all these are minor issues to me.But 4GB RAM is a pain to me, especially I like to preload the contents when I have good Wifi access, that consume much RAM. The tab management and session management extensions can't help me much to save RAM.32GB storage is another pain to me that I am forced to delete some downloaded TED and Google Play Movies, and the Android game Final Fantasy Tactics. The microSD can't help on these. 64GB internal storage should be the minimum for Chromebook running Android apps."	1	1	0	1	4
Sorry but this is the slowest computer that I have owned. About 6 years ago I actually found a MacBook air on the side of the road, honestly, that must have been left a cars roof and blew off. But that being said it's 6 years older and 5 times faster than this one.	3	6	2	8	3
Great deal - Great Chromebook! Arrived today and booted up instantly with great performance. I was up and running in minutes. For the price its perfect for my school classes and budget. The display is HUGE and clear for my needs. Its a NON-GLOSS display and perfect for all the basics. Good keyboard and soft touch keys. It also has plenty of room to rest your palm so thats nice but I always use an external mouse. I never had a Chromebook and was surprised there is NO Delete Key. I looked over and over and NO delete key. I find that when you Right Click you can delete stuff. I thought it was listed as Black its really a Dark Charcoal Grey which I love even more! Professional packing and all.	3	1	0	0	2
Super fast computer with SSD Drive, great value	3	7	3	8	1
The HDD on this laptop is soooooo slow. It's a real bottleneck that will allow you down. Windows updates take hours. Programs that use lots of disk writes will slow you to a crawl. Other than that, it's a good laptop.	3	6	2	9	3
The hard drive gave out completely after 1.5 years of casual use (no crazy programs or massive data files).	2	6	3	8	3
I work in IT for a living. I can tell you that a computer with an Intel i7 processor, solid state boot up drive with 1 Tera byte extra hard drive for under $1200 is a bargain. And it doesn’t have that annoying reflective screen that 4 some reason most do these days. This is my first MSI laptop. I used to be loyal to hp, but those kept failing. By a ‘gaming’ laptop if you need one for business. The word ‘gaming’ means they are high performance.	3	8	3	8	0

Pros:- I work in IT and it has all the features you'll need (DVD burner, plenty of USB slots, HDMI, ethernet)- Keyboard is full size and works great- TPM for a little extra security- Works perfectly with Linux (Tried Linux Mint, Fedora, Arch)Cons- It's a bit bulky (probably because of the DVD drive)- Plastic construction- Extremely slow if you don't replace the hard drive with an SSDOther- Fingerprint reader works poorly in Linux but it's a security threat anyway (Works great in Windows)	3	6	2	8	3

So far I really love this notebook. I bought one of the first generation Chromebooks and even though I understood that it was meant purely for accessing the internet I was disappointed. I then bought an ASUS Chromebook that only lasted about 8 months. It just went black one day and I couldn't get it to come back on. Fortunately they aren't too expensive. THIS HP Chromebook is amazing. It allows me to play games of all kinds, it's fast ---- there's just nothing to complain about.	2	1	0	0	4

Honestly this laptop does me wonders. I play all of my games very smoothly and I only got this laptop for $900. The keyboard feels great, the backlit keyboard is awesome. Fast start up with windows being on the SSD while I could install my games on the hybrid disc. Honestly, if you're looking to buy a laptop well under $1000, this is a pretty good choice. If you want to upgrade to 16GB of RAM, you could do it easy.	3	7	2	8	0

"Very disappointed with this product. This is supposed to be a new, signature addition laptop, but I have had nothing but trouble with it. I have the highest McAfee protection on it, I run multiple scans, and I don't download anything funky. There is no excuse for this why this shouldn't be top notch! It is so slow and it constantly lags...not happy. I have the highest internet that Cox Communications provides and I'm STILL getting a ""not responding"" message at the top of my search engine."	3	9	2	8	6
Laptop sucks. Updates and loads extra slow. It took 22 hours for my laptop to download and install all windows updates. Laptop never connects to my wifi and my laptop battery drains faster than it should because it's trying so hard to connect to the wifi. It will connect for a minute and disconnect but it will show that it's still connected to my wifi. I bought an Ethernet cable but I don't want an Ethernet cable to my laptop. I should've just got a desktop computer I guess. The point of a laptop is to take it around with you, not sitting on your desk hooked to an Ethernet cable because it can't connect to WiFi. I've had this laptop for about two weeks and I've only used it once because it was hooked to an Ethernet cable. Other times I've tried it without the Ethernet cable and it doesn't work. Waste of money if you ask me.	3	0	0	8	2

Great computer for the price but you should probably factor in a ~$30 SD Card to get some more storage. There are a lot of things moving to the web so storage space is less and less important but only 32GBs hurts when the Windows 10 Operating System takes up about 28 GBs, there's going to be some things that you need to install on this machine.Going to be using this computer for school and need to get Visual Studio installed but don't have the space, I'll report back on any issues with that installation but looking at minimum requirements for Visual Studio everything should be pretty smooth.	2	0	0	1	5

"It might a bit too early to write a review, but I've had this for a few solid days now and overall impression is excellent.For $200, you have to forgive its shortcomings and set your expectations realistically-- but it is still impressive what you can do with a laptop computer that costs less than your average tablet. Even at $300 or $400, I'd say this is still a good buy.Like a lot of people, I have multiple computers that each serve a niche. I have: Apple MacBook Air 13"" Early-2014 (i5 with 256GB SSD), iPad 2 32GB, Samsung Note 4, Note 5, Note 3, Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, Galaxy S5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S, etc. [I buy and sell used and fix phones, so I have a lot of phones: main phone now is the Note 4...], and an old home-built AMD Windows 7 Desktop (used to be gaming machine with 2 video cards).My #1 rule with laptops is that it has to be light and portable, otherwise why bother. In real estate, it's ""location, location, location"". In laptops, it's ""weight, weight, weight"". This is why my MacBook Air is my main computer. I carry that thing everywhere and battery life is great. But alas! I have a need for a Windows computer, and my old home-brewed desktop is aging (almost 10 years old now) and I figure a lightweight laptop would be nice. Since it's not my main computer, I can forgo a lot of features and storage space, so I was looking for something compact and light. I used to have a ""netbook"" from Samsung about 5 years ago which was very small with cramped keyboard and very very slow, and I wasn't impressed. So I bought this E200HA with some hesitation that it might be the same type of ""netbook"". For $200, what the hell, I said...I mainly need a Windows machine because I currently run a few Windows-only programs on my Mac via emulation and as anyone knows, emulation is very laggy and slow. So the 2 things my Windows laptop needs to run are: 1. Quickbooks, which I use for my small business accounting [their Mac version doesn't have features that their Windows version has, which I need (inventory-related features)], and 2. Proprietary BMW software for reading error codes and programming the car (INPA, EDIBAS, NC Expert, etc.). Mind you, I've been running these on my Mac for a few years now, but at painfully slow speeds. The Asus E200HA handles these software well, so it serves it purpose and therefore I am happy.But beyond that, it impressed me with its long battery life (I got about 11 hours at 80% screen brightness and moderate use), multi-task ability (4GB of RAM)-- I have 10 tabs open in Google Chrome and no lag. I don't know what some of the other reviewers saying you can't have more than 2 tabs open... YouTube videos stream fine. I have an average of about 3-4 programs open in addition to my Chrome browser and it works fine, no lag, no crashes.The computer's internal drive is 32GB SSD (solid-state drive-- no moving parts), which after the default Windows 10 64-Bit Home Edition install leaves about 17GB of free space for storage. I put in a 64GB MicroSD card in the slot for extra storage, but haven't used it yet. I'm down to 8GB free on my main SSD. A 128GB SD card also works, FYI, even though officially Asus says 64GB max. The faster USB 3 port is to the left and the slower USB 2 port is to the right. They work as intended. I hooked up my external Seagate Slim 2TB drive to the USB 3.0 port and transfers are fast as expected. The power supply looks a bit like a USB or Thunderbolt, but it's not-- it's a proprietary plug. The charger itself is very light, like a cell phone charger. External video is possible via a mini HDMI port (you need a mini-HDMI to standard-HDMI cable or adapter-- the cable is like $7 from AmazonBasics, not too bad). The trackpad is large like on a Macbook, and has gesture, but not as elegant or good as the one on my Mac, but still good for 2-finger scrolling and touch tapping. The keyboard is a bit plasticy and light and a bit smaller scale than a full-size keyboard, but not too shabby. Screen isn't anything impressive, but it gets quite bright at 100% brightness. ASUS has a guarantee on dead pixels, so that's good to know.All in all, for $200 this is quite a bargain and a great little computer. The 32GB internal storage was a concern for me, but if this isn't your main computer, it's nothing to worry about. If it is, you need to budget ~$40 for a 128GB SD Card or ~$80 for an external USB 3.0 2TB drive."	2	0	0	1	5

I open up a window nothing happens okay I click on it again then all a sudden 15 windows open and lord have mercy buckle in because its going to take 50 minutes to try to close that. THEN it would randomly shut it self down after 5 minutes of inactivity!

This is the best deal I've found on an HD laptop with DDR4 memory, and RJ45 network port. The HDD can be upgraded to SSD later, as well as the memory. My only problem is that the trackpad is pretty far to the left, which I have always found is a problem for those of us who are right-handed - I keep right clicking instead of left clicking! A mouse is necessary to save your sanity.	3	6	2	8	3
For a computer that is supposed to have 16 gb of ram this thing lags and all my programs freeze up one at a time randomly and I have to task manage them to shut it down and reopen it. Very poor product. Technical support not much better. there was a problem with the numbers pad it kept acting like the mouse. and tech help could do nothing to solve the problem. I finally figured it out my self while waiting ten minutes for the girl in the Philippines to ask how to solve the mystery when all it was is a easy access setting found in the control panel. so frustrated my mom bought one and no issues I decide to take the leap to Lenovo and now I regret it. Also my warranty was out dated the same day I bought it I had to send proof of purchase and Lenovo still has not replied to let me know if the warranty has been updated yet.	3	9	2	8	6

"I wanted a machine for email, internet, and various office functions. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. IT is slow when you're use to tablets and high speed computers with ""instant on"". After it's on, it works very good. It is also lite and easy to carry with a good battery life and screen."	0	9	0	2	4

I’m super happy with mine and the price was right for me. My old HP died and I knew I’d have an impossible time replacing the nice keyboard and design of the lap top itself, which was comfy, fluid, etc. This is a very good purchase for me. I have too many other expenses to spend more. Picture and sound great. Called support number for a refresher on a few things. The version with less GB got 5 star reviews so I got this one.	4	6	4	8	3

"So, this was the worst purchase I've made in a long time. This is the 3rd refurbished PC I've bought, the 1st I've ever purchased from Amazon. When I received it I had 5 days to customize it and transfer all of my file from my older laptop to give that one to my daughter for her birthday, and use this one as my new laptop.First, when I turned the laptop on, it wouldn't boot. It said there was no boot device found. Big ""UH OH!"" for me. So then I did some diagnostics and found that the hard drive was there, with absolutely nothing on it. So I thought... ok, I'll access the restore partition that all Dell's have and restore it to the original factory OS. Well... no partition could be accessed. So I knew there was an even bigger problem going on.I then created a partition-restore image to use to repair the damaged partition and restore factory images. Well.... the restore partition was so corrupt that it could not be repaired.So then I called Dell and explained the issue. They couldn't believe someone would sell me a ""Refurbished PC"" claiming to be in good order and with Windows 10 installed on it, and have it be so horrible. They referred to it as a paperweight. I even sent them the link to the item I purchased and they laughed at what I had sent to me. A complete inoperable piece of junk.I asked if they could send me a restore disk and they said that I had to realize that all drivers would be gone and a disc would not be read. But I could program a USB to restore the PC to original images as long as the computer would allow itself to be repaired.It took me 12 hours to get Windows 7 on the laptop, and an additional 5 hours repairing and restoring drivers to get it to work even semi-well.I did not have time to send the laptop back and wait for a better one (hopefully) to show up. My daughter's birthday was coming.And now that the laptop is working well because I did what the seller should have done in the first place, I'm not sending it back. They SHOULD be paying me for the technical work I did though.I am SO irritated at this purchase.This definitely shows me though that NO ONE is checking to make sure the refurbished PC's actually work. Just that they power on."	2	6	0	7	2
I absolutely HATE this computer. The keyboard is hard to type on. Typing on a document disappears and I never know what I touched to cause it. I wish I could return it for credit and purchase a laptop. Anything but a Dell. Never again will I purchase a Dell.CAN AMAZON HELP ME TO RETURN THIS FOR EVEN PARTIAL REFUND?	3	4	2	8	3
So far so good. It came as advertised gtx 1050ti. Battery life is prettt bad. No gaming and light use, I was needing a charge after 2 hours. I paid for one day shipping and Amazon botched it. Seen it coming too,and questioned them on it,but they assured me it was on schedule. They took care of it of course.	3	6	3	3	0

"For such a high spec computer, very disappointed. Locks up regularly, cannot handle more than 1 function without locking. Gives the reason as ""driver error"" every time. You would think that the drivers would be have been checked out for compatibility with the rest of the machine."	3	7	3	8	6

When I first received this PC it was amazing it was the best bang for you buck PC I could find. It ran all my games max settings and around 60fps. Mind you I treat this PC like a God and have a nice cooling stand and it never moves from my desk. All I do is game and leave my Desktop to my regular computer needs. Ive had this PC for 3 months now and I cant play any demanding games without the CPU maxing out to 100% and causing major shuddering. This did not happen at first but now games like GTA5 have a 60% GPU usage and 100% CPU. Usually the bottleneck is the GPU but for some reason its the CPU on this PC. I have the task manger out any there is no other application hoggign the CPU its just the games causing this to happen.TLDR; CPU major bottleneck always 100% usage	3	7	2	8	0
Satisfied with the purchase. Screen, speakers, keyboard, they are all top-notch. Great materials and build. But most importantly, CPU and GPU (GTX 1070) performance is excellent. The fan does get loud at times, but not that bad in my opinion.	4	7	5	8	0

One week in and I am very satisfied with this little laptop. My primary objective for this purchase was to have a small portable laptop that was still powerful enough to do some fairly heavy multitasking between online browsing, streaming and microsoft office. This little machine has been more than sufficient and has actually been able to keep pace a little better than my work issue desktop machine. I find myself building out complicated excel files with ease while having 2-5 webpages and a couple streaming video players open at the same time no problem. I highly recommend this laptop, even more so when you factor in the cost	2	0	0	1	5
So far i'm impressed with this laptop. I have not run a game on it yet but all web pages only take about 4 seconds to load tops. The fan for this is also dead quiet. one thing that is disappointing, my wireless mouse does not work on the very smooth surface of this laptop. My old dell was textured and it worked fine. The only surface it will work on is the built in mouse itself. Also when i'm on YouTube and I start a video it does a 5 second glitch fest when starting and ending a video. I think its just starting computer hiccups. One thing that I really like is the back-lit keyboard. Iv'e never had one and now that I do it's super cool. I do hope dell looks at this review about the wireless mouse not working. that was a bummer because now ill have to cut out a mouse pad to it's shape and if I leave it in the laptop wont close and it's gonna be really annoying to carry a round. I hope I find more amazing things about this laptop as I explore.========================================UPDATE============================================================I am becoming displeased with this laptop. I was trying to play a game called Stardew Valley (AMAZING GAME by the way) and whenever I had to shut it to do something else the screen would freeze and I would have to restart it, losing all my progress since last save. and sadly in stardew valley there isn't any save button. I'm in limbo If I should return it And get a new one or what.	3	8	3	8	0

Everything you would want in a laptop-lightweight-GREAT screen in my opinion (laptops have trouble having good screens)-long lasting battery charge-charges fast-SUPERB KEYBOARD....-Trackpad is just fine for me, others complain but I haven't had a problem. If anything it's great.-wide viewing angle FHD-Thin-Finger print reader-Good SSD (Nothing crazy but just good enough)-I can run SFV / RCT3 (Street Fighter V, 720p/low settings / Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, 1080p nearly maxed settings) both at 60fps+ with the right settings. (Gaming)-great resolution screen, super clear once you set everything up-No real junkware on here, everything like ASUS Hello (gives free dropbox 12 month for 30gbs), sets up your warranty / acc. to ASUS Splendid (screen), that Vivid option is great.-Super good for price (Performance to price ratio)-Has auto brightness, but I turned my option off but it has a sensor for darkness / brightness of the screen-Dual mic for better qualitySometimes I even turn *down* the screen because it's too bright at times. Currently my screen writing this review is on 33%.neutral:-power button is near backspace. I have no problem with it.. I'm too muscle memory to press random buttons but I can see how beginners / non-tech savy / or butterfingers can press it by accidentcon:-Bad webcam. If you need a webcam, buy an external and still get the laptop!! Gladly, I don't use a webcam.Hit me up under this thread if you want to know something specific.	2	5	2	3	4
Anazing laptop so far I have had it a month no issues I play PUBG , League , fortnite and more all smooth on the highest settings and PUBG actually loads textures well.

I've had it 3 days and I am pretty disappointed. I bought a new one of these at best buy on sale and I was looking for another one at a better. Next time I'll wait for it to go on sale again, this is not worth the minimal savings.This morning it wouldn't turn on. I looked up the issue using. You phone and found a solution. Got it to work... But for how long?This looks like it has been through a battle. Top part is much whiter than bottom/keyboard part. Deep, visible scratches above the power button and escape on keyboard. Some of the back seems to have white out on it. There are random ink stains in colors like purple, white and pink on the back. Looks really used.	2	1	0	0	4

I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement.

Received the first one as a gift. The outer box came in severely damaged, the inner box (the actual laptop box) also had damage. I pulled it out, the unit itself didn't have any damage. Plugged it in so it could charge, after several hours, it still wouldn't power on. I returned it, which was a mess all in itself because it was a GIFT to me.With the credit from the return, I purchased another one of the same thing. The first one should have been my warning. I have had this since October, and in less than two months, and DEFINITELY outside of the return /exchange window, the new one has stopped working as well.1) I will never buy a laptop that I can't have in my hands immediately...no more online laptop purchases, and 2) I will NEVER purchase this brand ever again. Two bricked laptops in less than two months makes me beyond unhappy.	3	2	1	8	7
This computer is so slow it is not possible to actually use it. I don't know if it's defective or if this is just a really poor design, but either way, it's going back and I would not recommend buying it.	3	0	0	8	2

I had my original laptop (a Toshiba Satellite M505) since 2010 and it work well for everything I used it for. Then last month the second battery died along with the charger, so it was time to upgrade and after looking at all the options I choose the Dell Gaming laptop. I've had it for about a month now and so far, it has been a wonder to explore. The processing speed feels lightning quick compared to what I had and the quality of graphics is quite nice. I found the backlight for the keypad to be an amazing feature letting me type when its dark or hard to see well inside. I'm still learning about the other features and programs pre-installed but so far, they have shone usefulness (NVidia GeForce account, Xbox connection, Windows Defender, etc.). I should also talk about Windows 10, my original laptop started with Windows 7 and worked beautifully till they upgraded to Windows 10. It still ran well but certain programs and links to accounts simple got lost or could never connect. This laptop came with 10 so it has those bugs solved and most of the issues solved. Now for the big one: the gaming experience, was it good? Answer: yes, like I never have before! Playing on or offline, plugged-in or not gaming has never been so smooth for me. I joined steam ad installed Hollow Knight and it’s been a blast all the way. Battery life with last between 7 to 5 hours while gaming, and supposedly up to 15 hours when passive, unheard off for my previous laptop. As for the cons of this computer, not many but they are distinct. This laptop comes with a SD card slot, 3 USB ports, a LAN plug, and a HBMI port. It does have a DVD player, this can be a pro or con since there are no major moving parts inside to break or collect dust, but it means music discs ad movies will need to be on flash drives or you need to get a portable DVD player. The other major issue can be price, at 900 it can be pricey, though compared to other laptops with some of the same features it’s a good deal. So, in summary: Pros - great control, lightweight, good graphics, long battery life, useful built-in features and programs, solid-state hard drive with no moving parts, and strong compatibility with Windows 10. Cons - no DVD drive and soft keyboard along with a mid-range price tag. Overall, I have enjoyed the Dell experience and I have to say I love learning everything this computer has to offer.	3	8	3	8	0

It's fast. It's clean. But I didn't know and didn't see anyone anywhere mention that with a chromebook, you can't download other browsers easily. I also don't like that there's not a caps lock button. Not used to that, and when I hit where it usually is, it brings up a google search box.

"To be honest, the worst mistake I could have made was buying this Dell computer. I searched so much on the internet, I read and they convinced me to buy this model. But it has been a total loss of money.From the beginning it was super slow, the technical support of Dell tried to help me by phone, but they did nothing. A month and a half ago it completely went out and it did not turn on anymore. Apparently all at a certain point reflect this failure. The technical support made me send it to Texas to the repair center, and there it lasted almost a month. Then It arrived last week and two days later it went off again and did not turn on, AGAIN!. I just called to make the return, because I do not want this computer anymore, how is it possible that after two days of coming ""Repaired"" will be damaged again ?. But they just say to send it back to repair (AGAIN) and I can not return it.Please, do not waste your money buying this computer which in itself is slow, has very poor quality and technical support."	3	8	3	8	0

The purchase of a Surface laptop has been the most negative customer experience of my life. And I've dealt with banks and insurance companies.I bought the Laptop in early August and was happy at first, as it seemed like a good alternative to the MacBook / Pro. After about 45 days of light to no use, the laptop failed completely and tech support was unable to resolve, so refund / replacement was the only option.I thought about it and based on the news that had recently come out re Consumer Reports and the very high failure rate, I opted for refund, as my spidey sense told me this product had been rushed to market. I asked for a refund; as I was at 45 days vice 30, the request would have to be referred up for approval, response in 24-36 hours. Fine. A week goes by, nothing heard - I call, they advise 'your request has been denied.' Fine, I'll go with replacement, sell it on Kijiji, buy a MacBook. They send me ... a refurb. A highish end laptop fails after 45 days and MS believes a refurb is a fair trade. Now I'll have difficulty selling the laptop. I call back and say no way, not acceptable. They say 'just go in person into the store, they'll give you a brand new one.' The nearest store is 4 hours by car, can't do, have to do it via courier. They say 'We can't send a new laptop via courier, if you're genuinely not happy, ask for a refund'. I advise already tried, no success. They said, no, I'm looking at your file, a refund was never requested. So I waited for a week just to find out that first agent lied outright to me.Bottom line - I'm more than 2 weeks without a laptop, have spent in excess of 7 hours on the phone they consistently refuse to refer me to head office or any other level of customer support that might be able to authorize replacement with a new computer via courier. Apparently only Bill Gates himself could authorize such a thing, and he's busy. They have have ignored queries sent over email, Facebook and Twitter. This is what you can expect when your Surface fails.My sincere recommendation is buy a MacBook; the reliability is one thing, but the arrogance and ineffectiveness of MS customer service team is what makes me certain I WILL NEVER BUY A PIECE OF MS HARDWARE FOR ME OR MY FAMILY AGAIN. I've never had a major failure of an Apple desktop or laptop, when I've had issues with peripheral devices they have replaced even out of warranty.The product is not ready for market, the company is not willing to work with the poor suckers who got on early to try to find a good outcome. I will be buying a MacBook as soon as this circus is resolved.	2	7	2	3	3

Volume was not working. I called Asus support 2 days after receiving my laptop. They said I probably needed to add some additional drivers or get some driver updates. They would help me only if I bought an ongoing support contract with them. I refused. Told them I had it for 2 days and it is a brand new machine and that they should support it. Their answer was that because I bought it from Amazon it was not their problem. They would have done it for me at no cost if I had bought the laptop directly from Asus. Horrible way to run a company so I returned the item and am looking at hp laptops.	3	7	3	8	3

I LOVE IT! As soon as I got it i noticed that the color was not as shiny as I thought it would be but it is still a rose gold color. Really light weight and the keyboard is perfect. Reminds me of a mac design which is perfect. Considering I haven't had it for two weeks it has done a lot of upgrading. Which makes sense because it's new but all it does is update and after all the updates were installed it said my storage was almost full which I did not like. After going through all my apps and deleting a couple things it lowered the storage but not enough; will have to buy more storage because I am a college student but other than that I am really satisfied with the product would buy again.	2	0	0	1	5

I've wanted a Surface computer for awhile and I'm so glad I bought it. I shopped around before deciding on Amazon. The free 2 day shipping sealed the deal for me.

"Extremely happy with this laptop for the price. Updating review after 2 weeks. Great battery life and thin, lightweight profile. I have however, experienced a few issues with the lack of storage and trying to run windows updates. But once I started deleting the previous version of windows, cleaning up the drive, temp files and uninstalling programs I don't need, it freed up space to install more updates. I also purchased a 64GB SD card for additional storage at $20. This laptop works great for email and shopping, great picture on the display, writing papers and playing Solitaire. Love it!!! I'll update in the future if this Acer runs into problems, but so far so good. Lastly, I love the ""night light"" feature which turns the screen an amber color to block blue light after sunset so the light from the screen doesn't impact your sleep. I have my hours set from 6:30pm to 6:30am. Very pleased and I recommend this little laptop as long as you note that storage is an issue and you will have to uninstall programs and delete temp files, etc in order to keep running updates and either store everything in the cloud or on an SD card."	2	0	0	1	2
This is a great laptop for on the go emergencies and presentations. I'm an IT guy, so it's fine for Remote Desktop uses and web browsing. You can also use it for media consumption watching YouTube and Netflix, or any downloaded videos in general. Be warned though, if you need to run serious apps like Office and Project, it would work but the result would be painfully slow. Some JavaScript heavy websites like outlook can also bog it down. It'll come to a crawl if there's a background update going on at the same time. Don't get me wrong, you can actually do almost everything except gaming if you are patient enough and don't mind some slowdowns here and there, and careful with what you run at the same time. If you download a lot of stuff, you'd need to get a minimum of 200GB microSD card. With 64GB of internal storage, I have the OS 10 Pro upgrade, Office Suite, 3 main internet browsers, SQL Management Studio, and I have about half left, not leaving much room for big video files.	2	0	0	1	5
The laptop have a great build, the windows version is limited exactly as the office that brings. The wifi card sometimes gets crazy and swicths off, to solve this you need to disable the battery saving option. Essenciallly i buy this laptop to install ElementaryOS and so far was a great experience, some people said there's no option for Hardrive but my version have the space to add one and it works, in fact you can run that disk first in boot and even run a OS there.	2	0	0	1	5

I wanted a sleek clamshell laptop in aluminum for while because all the kids on campus have them, but have always used Windows, so I was excited to see this come out. I bought it for productivity (word processing, creating slides for classes, programming, photo editing and light graphics design) and it has proved a fun machine to use because of the portability and good looks. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro so I could use legacy software. The laptop has enough processing power for anything I've used it for and is nice and light. The keyboard is comfortable, the trackpad is smooth and accurate and the battery life is enough to get through most of the day with the performance and screen brightness jacked up.The screen is excellent and the build is solid. The fabric on the keyboard is holding up after four months' use and feels good.I'd be happy if they made the laptop a bit thicker put a bigger battery in it and upped the storage, but I feel that way about all my electronics. My only other minor gripe is that there is a lip at the front of the keyboard that doesn't seem to have a purpose (maybe to help opening the lid), and would be more comfortable if rounded. I had no intention of gaming on this, but as a surprise bonus, it streams my Xbox nicely.I used this successfully to expand the single USB 3.0 port to three and add Ethernet:Anker 3-Port USB-C to USB 3.0 Aluminum Portable Data Hub, with 10 Mpbs, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps, or 1 Gigabit Network Adapter with Ethernet Port, for MacBook Pro 2016, ChromeBook, XPS and More	2	7	2	3	3
Bought two of these, both had a few hours of updates out of the box, which is to be expected. Downloaded and installed Guild Wars 2 immediately (the reason I bought two of these, for me and my wife) it runs it perfectly on max settings at 70+ FPS. Fans only kicked in when I joined a heavily demanding pvp match and they were very quiet. As to be expected for a laptop it runs a little warm, but let’s be honest there’s a lot of demand on such a small package. Overall though it is a superbly fast computer that has thus far met and exceeded my expectations for a $700 laptop. Will update review after a week or so, hoping for more good reviews of it!	3	6	3	3	0

Technically works. I had modest expectations for this laptop, but it consistently struggled to handle a single chrome tab. Just one. I just wanted to use this for google docs and not have to bother with the weirdness of a chromebook, but this just couldn't handle a single light task with any reasonable speed. Build quality is fine and the laptop looks good, but man, even for a light duty device, this just doesn't cut it.	2	0	0	1	2

Laptop works great, bought as a gift for my Brother in law. Here is the deal, I installed a Samsung 850 Pro inside the computer before I gave it to him so it is super fast. You will be hard pressed to find any AMD processors with SSDs preinstalled until Ryzen mobile chips become more popular. I chose this laptop because it gave the best gaming and photoshop performance for the price and It was a high end AMD processor and Graphics unit.	3	2	1	8	7

"Excellent Alternative to Windows PCs...FINALLY!!! New, this is around $300, mine is ""Refurbished"" for $188. And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS. One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative). No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans! Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser. Google provides lifetime Free Virus Protection, An Entire Suite of Office Apps called Google Docs (no Outlook or MS Works needed...YAY!) plus Hundreds more Apps at No Charge! Try it, You'll Like it."	3	1	0	0	2
Overall it's a very nice laptop -- light, thin, with a very nice screen and a great keyboard. I'll just mention one downside: the i7 version gets HOT, uncomfortably hot to leave it on your lap (especially if you're wearing shorts!). I'll look for an option to slow the processor while I'm running it on battery, which might reduce the heat a bit without killing performance. All thin laptops have this issue, but just wanted to point it out.	2	8	2	3	3
Do not buy!!! After my first two days of being on it it, the keyboard stopped working. And, then it got slower. By the time that you buy the ad card your looking at $250 like me. Spend a little more and get the Inspiron 11 2-1! I did and it is worth it!!!	2	0	0	1	5

Update May 2018: The laptop is pretty solid minus the failing drive mine shipped with. There was a mix up when the early review model was shipped to me so I received the wrong storage option. Asus support never responded to me despite multiple attempts to contact.TL;DR.. if you avoid the Single 1TB Hybrid Drive option, and utilize Amazon's return policy instead of ASUS support, it is a pretty solid gaming laptop. I swapped out the 1 TB Hybrid drive and problems went away. It is a very quick laptop with great graphic and CPU performance for the price.-----Things are not starting out well with this laptop. This is a new laptop so I do want to give ASUS a chance to address this. I will update this review as things develop.First of all, I was shipped the single 1TB spinning disk option (with the 8GB SSD cache built in, a.k.a the Seagate FireCuda 1TB), not the 256 SSD + 1TB HDD option I was supposed to review.I went to install some familiar games to run some benchmarks. I go away for a couple hours while the downloads run and come back to the machine crawling very slowly. I'm wondering why the download is going so slow and windows seems very sluggish, so I open up the task manager and find the hard drive is working really hard to keep up with a 2.5MB/second download. This is not at all normal behavior. I've attached a screen shot.I download Seagate's SeaTools utility and read the hard drive's diagnostic counters (SMART stats). SMART comes back clean (surprisingly), but the thing fails to complete even the short self-test, which clearly shows a failing drive. Another screenshot of that. A reboot changed nothing.Updated: Three contacts with ASUS support so far without any resolution.	3	7	5	8	0

"This computer is advertised as having a ""quad core"" processor which would seem to imply that at a minimum it is not slow. My experience with this machine for a few months now can best be summed up in one word, ""disappointed"". This computer is so slow that when using Microsoft Word, Edge, or Outlook, the screen display cannot even keep up with my slow typing. It lags at least a word behind. Very awkward. In addition it is incapable of going more than one level deep into any web site. If there are pages with photos to look through it simply stops and freezes. It has been OK for the purpose I intended which is reading my Kindle books using your Kindle for PC software, although it often takes more that a minute for the program to open. I would not recommend this computer to anyone who has even average speed requirements."	2	0	0	1	5

These Acer computers are a waste of money. Just save for something you know will last. I have had mine under a year and already it is giving me problems with regular functions, loading, and space. I use a portable hard drive for all documents/photos/music and save nothing to my actual computer yet this system claims to be full on memory and lags tremendously after minimal use. Save your money!!! Do not bother with any Acer product as they are low quality and low performance.	2	0	0	1	2
A beautiful, powerful, and lightweight laptop. I have bought mine in USA and I am just started to use it in my home, Brazil. By the moment it is working like expected, fast and quiet. But, does not have a regular hdmi port and unfortunately none adapter was included in the box, neither for the regular size nor to a vga port (for a such expensive computer and based on my experience with Asus - this is not my first Asus laptop, it was really disappointing). At home I like to use with a mouse and keyboard wireless and connected in a bigger screen (vga connection in my case). Just because of the lack of one or two adaptora, I give it the four stars, otherwise it would certainly five stars.	2	6	5	4	3
Has NO memory. I have 0 pics and videos on this machine, and hardly any documents. Yet, it doesn't even have enough memory for a windows 10 update. Also, the battery lasts about 30 minutes. The mouse is a little wild, even with adjusting. I do like that its light weight and I like typing on the keyboard. It starts up quick too. I like that best. However, I would not buy this again due to the memory and battery deficiencies.	2	0	0	1	2

I bought this computer a few months ago, and I've had many problems with it. First thing is that the fan turns on way to frequently, even when I'm browsing the internet; to top it off, it's very loud. Secondly, the display is pretty bad. Don't even talk about the frame rate. Also, physically, the parts are so brittle, I dropped it on my couch and half of the plastic things in front of the fan fell off. I had to spend a lot of money repairing that. Overall, if you are looking for a new computer, I don't recommend this one.	3	8	3	8	0

Great laptop, it can run pretty much anything you throw at it in good quality. Just make sure you download gpu-z to check if your 1050ti is there mine was but the on board software only picks up the integrated graphics which gave me a bit of a scare.

Don't get this if you plan on updating the windows... It doesn't have enough space.You can add space with a micro sd card however. Its fine for me but its annoying as heck every time I open it open up and it starts to download the windows update. I have to go into the task bar and shut it down every time. Its a cute little computer and I'm happy with it for just browsing the web but don't get it for anything other that and maybe writing papers on. The color is nice and the computer itself starts reasonable fast. It did come with a lot of bloatware that I had to go through and delete.	0	9	0	1	4
It was bigger than I thought which is great. This is the second chromebook I have so I wasn't amazed by all the features, but they WERE satisfactory. The speakers also work really well compared to my other chromebook. The packaging is probably what amazed me.....it came in a HUGE box that contained another box which contained a plastic bubble wrap thing that protected the chromebook. If I could buy this for someone as a present, I would. Overall, I like the chromebook and there isn't really anything that disappointed me. Also the chromebook is WAYYYY heavier than I expected.	3	1	0	0	2
This will get the job done but don't expect anything fancy. It can be slow to boot and is beyond slow to update.	3	0	0	8	2
I thought I should ignore the bad reviews, as there were a few glowing ones - and still try the computer.I hated everything about it. The keyboards backlight didn’t work well, the webcam for Skype kept cutting out in the middle of video calling and the sound was also subpar.The most frustrating thing however, was how slow everything is. After deleting the bloatware it seemed to do nothing to improve the speed. I’ve never returned an item to amazon before and hopefully the return is proceessed soon.TL;DR: save your money for a laptop of better quality.	3	7	3	8	0

No problems with this product for me. Was able to clean install windows easily. The computer does not lag one bit. It does come with the TN display.

This laptop would be great if the monitor wasn't so terrible. I had backlight bleed watching movies no matter how I set the brightness or contrast. Two of these were defective. I sure hope they don't consider this bleeding acceptable. My 6 year old Asus it replaced has darker black and no spill and it was only about 400 dollars. Too bad. This thing loads fast, is light weight, has plenty of power for work and play, but it's just terrible for doing any work with night charts, movies or anything other than surfing web pages. One computer had problems bleeding from the top left corner, bottom right and center. This one has some bleeding from the bottom left and just right of center. It is distracting and annoying. Completely unacceptable in this day and age. Frustrating as all heck. Thankfully, Amazon customer service processed my rant and is taking good care of me.Honestly, I would not purchase an asus product again after this experience. Quality control is extremely important in technology.	2	5	2	3	4

Pros:- Well made, sturdy.- Powerful, no doubt.- Pretty quiet for this type of laptop.- Very nice keyboard. Actually best laptop keyboard I've ever worked with.- IPS monitor.- It doesn't looks ridiculous like on pictures. It was the biggest concern of mine about this laptop, so it is a big pro for me. It looks a bit aggressive though, with all lights on (which you can turn off) but nothing more.Cons:- Heavy. Along with the adapter, which has a weight and a shape of a real brick, it makes a pretty heavy kit. For someone it is a desktop replacement, but I personally bought a dedicated Predator bag, which makes it somehow portable. - Fingerprints. If you have a cleaning kit and clean your laptop daily after work/gaming it won't be a problem at all.- Thermal solution. It is not great. But it is a common problem. I changed mine after a week of use and it helped to drop something like 15-20 degree Celsius. It could put to the end your warranty though, so think for yourself.- IPS backlight bleed. Mine arrived with very little bleed in the top right corner. Can see it in absolutely dark scenes on full brightness.Overall:Great laptop for the money. Best in my opinion.UPDATE: Battery drains while plugged into AC adaptor while gaming high demanded games. Should be aware of it. I didn't know that and it's a huge bummer.	4	7	5	8	0

My daughter’s HP laptop started giving up the ghost and she needed a replacement fairly quickly. I have had great luck with Acer laptops in the past so I thought I would try the Acer Nitro 5.My first impression is that this laptop was a bit bigger and heavier than most of the laptops I have purchased in recent years. The casing feels to be mostly of plastic. While it is solid and sturdy feeling, it does give it a bit of a cheap feeling.My daughter mainly uses the PC for academics and light gaming. For this, the PC has performed superbly.The only thing I thought was just OK was the sound quality. I know that laptops generally do not have good sound quality, but I thought the speakers and sound in this laptop were a bit mediocre. The sound was not terrible, but it sure was not excellent either.Personally, I loved the HD screen on this PC. The light up keyboard is a nice touch I thought. Battery life runs about 5 to 6 hours with surfing and online use.After about 6 months of use, the laptop is still running like a champ. I have yet to encounter an issue.Overall, I have been very happy with this laptop. I would highly recommend this latptop for someone looking for a good laptop at a good price.	3	6	3	3	0
"Laptop was packaged very nice, little bloatware, few updates to do right off the bat. Some Amazonians received a ""Chinese only"" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5"" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it."	3	7	2	8	0

First off, the laptop runs really well and runs my Steam library pretty well, and is generally pretty snappy when navigating the desktop. However, the trackpad feels a little weird/slow to me (I'll probably get used to it soon), and if the screen is tilted at the wrong angle, the lighting and colors are way off. Other than that though, it's a solid laptop, definitely an upgrade from the Lenovo Y510P that has somehow made it with me all the way through college.Really the only reason this didn't get a 5 star review is because a week after I got the computer, my I kept on getting a crash loop to the BSOD telling my I had a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error, and I couldn't use my computer for more than 30 seconds before it crashed again. I pulled out my old laptop (I'm currently writing this review on it) and looked up how to re-seat the RAM to see if it had been jostled loose or something, but even when I switched which slot it was in I kept on having crashes due to memory. LUCKILY, my boy Mohammed over at Dell support was on the phone with me while I was messing around in the chassis and Dell is sending me a new RAM stick free of charge. I'm a little bummed I won't be using my laptop for about a week but at least the customer support is good.I still would suggest getting this laptop. Just be aware that this might be an issue, might be worth ordering another 8GB of RAM with the computer and then returning it for free later if you don't need it. Have a good one people, happy shopping.	3	8	3	8	0
As a computer, it is okay, no complains about that. But be aware that it has no space to save almost anything in the hard disk, so when buying it don't forget to buy as well an SD card of at least 2GB to store your stuff.	2	0	0	1	4
"I have had the computer for about 6 months now. So far, so good. I would give it a 4.5 stars, but as that is not an option will give it 4 stars. My main gripe so far for basic office use are: 1. while it charges super fast and perhaps that is the setting which will kill my battery, I don't think I ever would have gotten 8 hours of full work time on it, and 2. the power off button is right next to the delete key...I can not tell you how many times I have hit it by accident and switched off my computer unintentionally. However, I have not ""yet"" lost any valuable work as perhaps it is only putting the computer to sleep when I hit that the first time thereby saving my work. The mouse pad is not my favorite, but I did get used to it over time. Otherwise, very happy with this computer."	3	7	2	8	4
This laptop may not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive computers do, but it gets the job done at a more reasonable price. It is very quiet while operating and is super lightweight and portable. Meets all the basic needs of a student.	2	5	2	3	4

Good computer for the price. Very light weight. Very good volume. It has some features that are just irrelevant for home use but it is a business standard. I am happy with it. I wish the delivery had been as secure as the computer bag delivery was. They just left it at the door when I had a message that it had to be signed for due to the price. Luckily we were going out when the mailman was walking away, so no one got a chance to steal it.	3	6	2	8	3
Has the specs I needed for a reasonable price. Build feels slightly cheap, but since this laptop will mostly sit in one place it should be durable enough. About as small in physical size as any laptop WITH an optical drive can be, and I still have many DVDs I want to use on this laptop so getting one of the many laptops without optical drives was not an option.	3	5	2	9	3
Beyond disappointed. It deserves one star because the amazon delivery driver delivered it on time! I got this computer Saturday evening, last night after I fell asleep just waiting on my “file explorer” to load, I decided that I would return it because it’s been nothing but issues. Nothing loads in under 5 minutes.	2	0	0	1	5

Bought this ASUS P-Series to use as my daily driver for work and personal productivity stuff. I have had it for about 2 months now and I am pretty happy with the laptop. I pulled out the HD and replace it with a SSD I was using in my old laptop so I'm getting pretty good response from the laptop. I have a dual monitor setup at work that I was able to continue to use sine there is both a HDMI video and VGA video output ports. The Gen 7 i5 was a nice sweet spot for me. The fit and finish is not supper but for $500 bucks I'm OK with it. I travel everyday back and forth to work with the laptop and as long as you have a decent size bag (I have a large enough messenger bag) you should be good to go. Since this thing is all plastic if you do not have a decent laptop slot in your bag with good cushioning I would suggest you pick up a Laptop sleeve for some extra protection. I made a backup image of Win 10 build it shipped with and reinstalled the machine with Linux Mint, it has been running like a champ no issues. I only have two projects left to finish up my planned changes for the laptop. I will be bumping it up to 16GB of RAM (Not a big deal it comes with a single 8GB dim) you just need to order another 8GB dim and I will be ready to roll. The last change after that is I would like to ditch the included optical drive and install a second internal storage device, maybe even through to 1TB drive it came with back in there (It is a 5400RPM drive, made me sad) Afer that my Frankenstein build will be completed.At $500 it is worth the cash. My only other complaint so far is the plastic case is a bit of a finger print magnet. Not a huge deal I give it a wipe down once a week.	3	6	2	8	3

"I just received this laptop today and I'm returning it today. I've bought ""certified refurbished"" items before and had a good experience, but this was terrible. This laptop looked like it had been used by a child or teenager. It had magic marker spots all over the cover. The outer casing was filthy and chipped in multiple places. Overall it just looked terrible. Also, the model I received was not the model in the picture. None of the ports were the same as pictured and the color was completely different. This was clearly an older model, not the one pictured. Please don't make the same mistake I did, heed the warnings in the negative reviews. Amazon shipping was right on time and packaged nicely, as usual. Everything else about the product was not as advertised."	2	1	0	0	4
After not even 6 months of light to medium use my computer no longer works. The screen is all messed up. I would not reccomend.	3	1	0	0	2
Bought the laptop, and despite being brand new I shelved it for one year due to being incredibly slow compared to its brother, Asus' Chromebook C201, a nearly identical computer but with a different, ARM-based CPU. Every time I opened this computer, it took 25 minutes for Windows Update to do its thing before I just gave up, turned it off, and used the Chromebook. Seems like no matter how often I would use it, once a month, once a week, once every few days, it would do the exact same thing.Over the course of a year, I have accumulated maybe 6 hours of use out of it, to make an extremely optimistic estimate. Checked tonight with WinDirStat and Windows is using over 75% of the hard drive space, and wants more than there is space remaining to do its most recent update - thus it cannot update. I only ever installed two (2!) programs on this computer - Google Chrome, and a utility used for tuning vehicle control modules (HPTuner) which is why I needed a Windows laptop in the first place.I have not stored any media nor any files on this computer beyond 1MB worth of control module configurations.This is not a Windows computer. It is a brick. It is a shelf ornament. It is ridiculous. The hardware's probably good, maybe, but I never got a chance to use it. Maybe I'll figure that part out when we install Linux, which seems to be the only way to turn this into a usable computer.Chromebook is fine though, thousands of hours of use and never had to worry about hard drive space.	2	0	0	1	5
This little laptop exceeded the expectations for the price. The keyboard is really good, you can type fast after using it for a few hours. I bought this laptop only for traveling because of the size. At first when I saw this laptop I realized that it is really handy because it's small and does not weight much at the point that I believe one book could be more heavy. It is really good computer for college students. My son played with it for some time and it is now considering buying it for college. The computer for the price and specs is okay. You can browse the internet with a few tabs open, watch videos and have some programs open and it will run smoothly. To conclude, I recommend this computer to anyone who wants it to use it for traveling or for college students who needs to type papers and use the internet.	2	0	0	1	5
I was worried at the beginning with this laptop, Acer is not one of my favorites companies but this computer is awesome, is really quiet and can run any game without problems, one of the things that was hard to me to find was the refresh rate of the screen but it is 75hz and the screen does have G-SYNC I can confirm that.	4	7	5	8	0
Good purchase for being a refurb but I had to get it fixed within the first week of use because it wouldn't properly update which resulted the computer in restarting constantly, slowing it down and freezing. Once I got it fixed and updated, I haven't had any issues since. I'm OK with having to get it fixed being that it was a refurb and cheap enough but was more of an inconvenience.	2	0	0	1	2

"I've had an ASUS Zenbook for about a year and a half ASUS ZenBook UX303UA 13.3-Inch FHD Touchscreen Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 10 (64 bit) That I've really liked and been happy with. It's smaller than this ASUS laptop, but has similar specs for processor and RAM power. My Zenbook was my first laptop with a SSD drive instead of a hard-drive, and while I do really like it and am happy with it, I'm always worried I'll use up all the space on the SSD and so I end up relying on Microsoft cloud storage much more than I'd like to. I saw this ASUS with a 1 TB hard drive - which is pretty huge - and decided to snap it up. We're using it as our ""family"" computer, and sort of the central repository for documents, photos, etc. We use it directly, but also access it via our home network for stuff. It's easy to work with and so far seeming to be a really nice laptop. A few years ago I avoided ASUS, thinking they were crappy despite the many good reviews. However, I've since changed my opinion and have become a big ASUS fan, with now 2 ASUS computers and 3 ASUS zenfones. So, here's why I've had a change of heart along with my review which leans heavily on comparing this laptop with my ASUS Zenbook.....My history with ASUS and why I went from hating them to loving them:Originally, way back when, my husband had a couple of ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy because he went through two of them within a years time as they'd always malfunction. Well, we realized it's him - seriously! - there's something about him and the windows platform that doesn't work well together and he seems to just kill all his microsoft computers (even his work issued Dell dies and malfunctions constantly when he has to work from home). For home use he switched to a Mac (which I despise, but to each his own...) and he's been a happy camper for 3 years now - a record for him!Meanwhile, a little over a year and a half ago I nervously bought an ASUS Zenbook after having disappointing performance & two BUS replacements due to factory build issues on a thinkpad within a year of (very expensive) purchase, followed by repeated fan failure on an HP after only 2 months (the HP was supposed to be the replacement for the crappy thinkpad). I then sought out what had the best reviews for a small, lightweight laptop that also had strong performance and reliability, and at that time the ASUS kept coming up again and again, with the Zenbook being their smallest/lightest version. The Zenbook has been great, much more hearty and stable than all my various past laptops, and is able to handle the 100+ tabs I often have open in my browser when researching (I kid you not, the last onetab app gathering up of tabs I had 181 open tabs, plus MSword open, pdf reader open and it was running fine and dandy!). I even ended up getting 3 ASUS zenphones because of my positive experience - and we love those as well! We have two Asus ZenFone 3 ZE520KL Unlocked Dual Sim Phone, 32GB, 5.2-inch, 3GB RAM, No Warranty - International Version (Moonlight White) and one deluxe ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.7-inch AMOLED FHD display, 6GB RAM 64GB storage Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone, US Warranty (ZS570KL-Glacier Silver) (I have the deluxe and love, love, love it!). Anyways, the point is I'm now a fully on board ASUS fan having had no problems and superior performance on all my ASUS devices over the past couple of years.THIS particular ASUS laptop:We wanted something we could store our many digital images and documents on, so something with a big hard drive (yes, I know I can just get an external hard drive for that - and we do have a few - but we wanted a laptop with a big drive built in and all the other performance features I've come to expect from my Zenbook). This met the criteria with the large drive, plus it has the same RAM and processor I've got in my Zenbook. My Zenbook has touch screen and this does not, but in the grand scheme of things I really don't use my touchscreen all that much. This has a long battery life, just like my Zenbook - unlike many computers that report a long battery life but in reality drain quickly, I've found my Zenbook to really and truly have a long battery life & so far this one has a similar reliability, although we don't use it on battery all that much. This is bigger, 15.6"" vs 13.3"" and 2lbs heavier than my Zenbook but still pretty lightweight for a bigger laptop & can easily be transported around. Should my Zenbook die (please say no) I'd have no issues taking this laptop on an airplane with me on a trip.This has TPM security & I honestly don't know what that is so I can't comment on that. It also has a fingerprint reader, and like the one on my Zenfone it works pretty well (wet fingers are the only time I find a challenge, so I have to do an extra drying after washing hands, etc. if I want it to read my print). The wifi connection and speed seems no different between this and my Zenbook and both clock the same speeds on our internet connection. I will say it doesn't start up instantly like my Zenbook does, but I think that's related to having a SSD drive vs a hard drive, as I believe that is a benefit to an SSD drive. However, it's not like it takes a prolonged amount of time to start up - for a laptop with a hard drive I believe it's where it should be.Special features of this laptop:There are special features on this computer since it's marketed as a ""business"" laptop. You can wake it over a network (something I'm not likely to do & haven't used so can't speak to this), and it has an easily accessed inside so that you can upgrade RAM. The battery is removable - something that used to be standard with most laptops and is now rare. I suppose if you travel it may be helpful to have an extra and swap it out? This, again, is a feature I don't really need or use. There is also an additional ""business"" app that ASUS put on there that's supposed to help when using this as a business laptop - I don't use this. I think generally heavy business users are more productive on systems that are faster and more powerful (the processor and RAM) and that's most of why they're calling this a business laptop. However, unless you solely read email and surf the internet I think those are important features for most users and allow the flexibility to use it for most anything you might want. I think that also makes it possibly a good computer for entry level gamers, too.Possible use for gaming??My daughter has an Alienware, which is optimized for gaming. Gaming is intense on your onboard systems and so need stronger computers to handle them well. I don't do the super action games, but my zenbook and this laptop can handle Sims4 7 minecraft on the high quality/high definition graphics & screen resolution without stuttering or issues. However, when compared to what it looks like on my daughter's Alienware hers is absolutely much more crisp, clear and defined (part of this is her screen is also higher resolution even though my computer is high definition), and she has special memory and drivers allocated to graphics. However, I don't know how well this or my Zenbook would do on Overwatch and other fast moving online gaming platforms. BUT! Before she had her Alienware she was able to play Overwatch on a computer that had similar specs to what my Zenbook has, just at lower graphics. This makes me think that this laptop *might* be a good, low cost option for gaming for an entry level gamer - especially since it's easy to access the innards and upgrade RAM. Something to consider for those who aren't willing to fork out the big $$$ for expensive gaming laptops (although I will say we initially weren't willing to spend the money, but eventually we caved and bought the Alienware for our daughter and she definitely has less power issues, better graphics and better timing responses when gaming while also being able to use it for school and everything else needed...).For StudentsThis is a great option for students, esp. college students for a low cost yet powerful laptop that can handle most anything they need. There is plenty of room for tons of documents (reports, class notes, downloaded documents, etc.) and it can handle having multitudes of tabs open for students who are doing a lot of research online. It also easily handles having several applications open at once along with the multiple tabs (Typically I'll have Word, Powerpoint, PDF reader, File explorer, and my browser with at least 30+ tabs open at once - and often two browsers, chrome and firefox, all at the same time. I teach online & do a lot of course and assignment creation, thus the many programs all open at once. As mentioned above, it also handles some gaming, although they may need to optimize it by adding stuff for fast paced gaming like Overwatch and FPS games.Lastly, from experience a few years back, when my husband kept killing his ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy - the customer service for repairs was good and sending in computers for repairs had a quick turn-around (under 2 weeks including mailing time both ways). However, we live in the SF Bay area and for us the repair center was also in the SF Bay area - perhaps it would be longer for folks who aren't so close to an ASUS repair center.SUMMARY: Nice, powerful, easy to use yet inexpensive laptop from a company that has demonstrated solid, reliable computers & phones. Great for Business users, students, and anyone wanting a fast & powerful laptop at a low cost. Reccommended."	3	6	2	8	3
"I compared a bunch of different laptops suitable for gaming and work. This one was the best price for the specs I was looking for. Build quality is nice. It doesn't feel cheap. It has a matte, slightly rubbery finish which feels nice. No, the screen is not an ips panel but it still looks pretty good. I have high quality monitors for my desktop and this screen doesn't bother me a bit. It can run most of the newest games on medium settings. I get 50-60 fps on BF1 and that's without any further tweaking. I thought the red accents would turn me off but it actually looks pretty nice. Not too ""loud"" or bright. The fans do get a bit noisy but not too bad to where it's annoying. Overall, I would say this is a great gaming laptop in it's price range. It boots fast and runs windows applications very quickly thanks to the ssd and i7. Almost as quick as my desktop with an i7, GTX 1080, 16gb ram, etc. You really don't need more than 8gb of ram unless you are doing some serious multi tasking."	3	8	3	8	0

I am using it to write this review. Well, I will not say it has the best specs if you compare to other gaming laptops. I just want a graphics card to run little editing stuff and light gaming. 1050 2GB for heavy gaming? You can dream about it.......The speaker amazed me! It is almost the same as using headphone when I listen to my favorite music, but you have to be right in front at the computer.Overall, the performance is good; the CPU is the lastest and fast.The keyboard is quite good and comfortable.I don't really like the red line design but I rather it is plain steel.The battery can let you use about 4.5 hours if you just internet and youtube.The wifi works perfectly like the advertising. It works well even though I am a little far away from the router and have a wall in between.The fan is not noisy, and the thermal control is very good. I feel slightly warm when I am using it to light works.I do recommend you buy the SSD version though. It is quite slow when I trying to install software even though it is an SSHD.I will add an SSD later.	3	6	3	8	0
"Where I can start, this has been my best laptop, the first days were a struggle, deleting the bloatware, updating drivers, downloading programs, passing file from my old laptop, the laptop was laggy sometimes, the laptop took a lot of time turning off and starting and I started to complain about my purchase, I had problems updating the Video Card, I didn't have administrator permissions, but those were little issues that I solved, then, updating all the things, drivers, setting the system for the best performance and following the instructions of others user, my laptop turned into a monster.It runs all the games that I want (Rainbow Six with all the settings full, GTA V in very high, PUBG in ultra settings,, etc) with 60+ fps and it's amazing. It doesn't overheat and now it starts really fast and it works great.I bought it for school, but I wanted something that could run some ""heavy"" games and this was more than I was expecting. This is my first ""gaming"" laptop and I'm really happy with my purchase. Now I'll get a SSD and more RAM and it will be the perfect laptop for this price.[TIP]If your graphic card appears as Intel HD Graphics use this this tip to change it to GTX's card.

I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews. Word of mouth is sometimes the best way to review a product vs. learning the hard way. I've only had this laptop for a few months and we're already considering purchasing another computer. It is slow.

It's very nice looking computer. The screen is sharp and the back lit keys are nice. It came with allot of bloatware. It periodically freezes upand sometimes loads slow. I never know when this is going to happen.. It's really a problem when I have to write an email report for my work and it does this. If I can't send a simple email when I need to, what good is it. I don't think I can send this back. I'm just sick about it. My advise is, buy a Dell.	2	6	3	8	3

So far it’s played 7 days to die and age of empires on max settings with no problem. Would recommend!	3	6	3	3	0

To my greatest surprise the first day after receiving this laptop keys from the keyboard started popping off. Additionally, the wires in the charger is broken after 6 weeks and i do not mishandle my laptop.

I had acer laptops before and i never encountered this, i regret my purchase.	3	4	1	8	3
User observations on the ASUS VivoBook S:The Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz processor lets me bring up applications far more quickly than on any computer I have had before.Even though the laptop frame size is what traditionally has house a 14” monitor, the narrow bezel allows it to hold a 15.6” monitor it seems larger.There is no wasted space and it uses almost the entire monitor, making for an impressively large picture.The picture is super crisp with very sharp images.The aesthetics are great. It is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops I’ve had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.My only complaint is that the Delete key is right next to the Power button. This, according to Murphy’s Law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on. For this reason, I give this computer four stars. Aside from that, I loved it.	3	7	2	8	4

Could not get over the weird concave bend in the metal chassis the Keyboard sits in. LG told me this is normal but it looks like a defect in the assembly. I cannot tell for sure if it is defect or design, but I don't want to risk it.Not sure why the flat metal area around the keyboard and below the screen would need to be bent downward in such a way.(To describe it one way, it looked a little like what you would expect your laptop Keyboard to look like if someone sat on it.)The metal top should be flat front to back and not curved at the back of or behind the keyboard.Otherwise Very Nice Packaging & Nice looking Machine. If it wasn't for the weird curved area around the top for the keyboard it would have been a keeper.	3	5	2	3	3

I didn't expect a fancy laptop because I was looking for reliability. I had only Dell until now but they have poor reliability and many times I sent them for repair so I decided to change since my last Inspiron 17 5000 failed in 14 months. (very disappointing)First time with Asus and I'm satisfied even when I have it less than a week, I think adding memory is a must so I will. Intel Graphics worked smoothly without blinking, easy to setup unlike USB-C ports whit adapters that cause problems. No bloatware (thank you) it will upgrade Windows 10 in the initial setup, lets see about reliability in the future.Good for the price!	3	6	2	8	3

A workhorse laptop with a large, HD screen, 16GB memory, quad cores, backlit keyboard, and large hard drive makes for a solid gaming or development platform — even better, this ASUS ROG STRIX Thin and Light Gaming Laptop is also (relatively) lightweight! Let’s take a closer look.Here are the basic specs, and be sure to also see the included pics:* 16GB RAM* 15.6″ full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels)* Storage: 256GB SATA SSD and 1TB HDD drives* Dimensions:15.1 x 10.3 x 0.9 inches, and weighing in around 5.6 pounds* CPU: 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core 2.8GHz (Turbo to 3.8GHz) with discrete GeForce GTX 1050 4GB graphics* I/O: Bluetooth 4.1, 3x USB 3.0, 1x USB 3.1 (Type C), 1x USB 2.0, 1x HDMI, 1x Mini DisplayPort, 1x headphone/Mic jack, and 1x RJ45 LAN port, and 802.11ac 2×2 WiFi* Keyboard: Aura RGB lighting keyboard with 4 isolated hotkeys, 1.6mm key travel, and anti-ghosting technology. 4 zones of lighting control. 20-million keystroke durability.* DVD: As the current trend, there is no DVD drive. I’m now accustomed to that, so don’t miss it. You can connect USB to an external DVD (eg Apple DVD drive worked) if you must.The laptop comes with Windows 10 Home as the OS. Both MS Office and MS OneDrive came pre-installed but unactivated. I used Control Panel | Programs and Features to uninstall both products, as this is targeted to be a development machine. I installed Oracle’s VirtualBox to run virtual machines. With quad cores, this is a good host for VMs.There is a numeric keypad, which would be good for accounting and tax chores. I loved the backlit keyboard and the ability to change the backlit colors with the pre-installed ASUS app. The touch pad did not have individual buttons, but was more of a universal pad where when you click on the left it is a one-click and if you click on the right it is a double-click. It took me about thirty minutes to get used to it, but now I like it.Since there are two WIFI adapters, you can connect to WIFI, and also share that WIFI with other devices, creating a hotspot. No cellular though — wouldn’t that have been a dream?Regarding the 1.25TB of space: The space is 256GB of SSD on which the OS is installed, and 1TB of HDD space that is available for end-user storage. The 1TB drive is end-user replaceable.The display is a very crisp 15.6″ full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels). This is *not* a touch screen, although I keep trying.The logo that appears on the back of the metal (aluminum?) lid lights up. Although the lid is nice, the base of the unit is plastic.The lithium ion battery life is OK — generally I got less than five hours of varied use including installing software. This workstations does have quad cores after all, and you’ll definitely hear the fan when it kicks on. The power brick is huge (not great for travel), but it does tend to charge the laptop quickly (within two hours).All in all this is a fast Windows laptop that could serve as a solid gaming or development platform, and I’m happy with it.I hope you found this review helpful!	3	7	5	8	0
Had this for a few months now and it is a monster! My wife plays SIMS 4 with every expansion pack all the time and it handles it like a champ! Very quick, tons of storage, moderately thin and light, great battery life. Lenovo is a great brand period. Buy it!	3	2	1	8	7
The laptop is EXTREMELY fast, much better than I anticipated. I use it to do homework while watching TV, instead of using our desktop. It's a chromebook, but I search the internet faster than prior gaming laptops I've owned. The machine runs like a champ. This was one of the best purchases I've made in the past couple of years. You usually get what you pay for, but this is a bargain and a great machine.	3	1	0	0	2

The ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 business standard Laptop is a great laptop on paper. Its packed with a 7th gen i5 processor, a full 1080p matt display and 8gb ram with a 1tb HDD. On Top of this, it is packed with business essential tools that make it not only easy for the individual but for IT as well. It has a fingerprint detector, wake up on LAN and a great, true to spec 9-hour battery.While this is great in terms of specs, when it comes to actually using the device it is a disappointment. One of the major grievances of this laptop is its display. The viewing angles are absolute garbage, and it will quickly darken if your off center when viewing your screen. The dpi is terrible as well, making things look more “pixelated” than they are. It's definitely a lower range 1080p display. Next, there are issues with the keyboard, in my experience, the keyboard is not nearly as responsive as it can be. I am writing this review on this pc, and often it seems like there are missed inputs, and for a laptop that advertises itself as a business-friendly pc, a business pc should have a great keyboard as its likely to be used to write documents.Then there are many other minor issues that cause complications between the software and the hardware of the pc. You will have to do a lot of troubleshooting with this laptop as features will seamlessly disable themselves and break with updates. There are issues with the fingerprint reader, it seems like every time I “fix” it, on the next restart it breaks again. This definitely seems like a driver issue that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the touchpad stopped working for me after uninstalling the Office application that comes factory loaded and had to go and get new drivers(Asus gestures) to fix it.Additionally, while this following issue is more of an individual case, my laptop came with a nongenuine version of windows. I had to go through Microsoft and get that issue fix, and that adds on to my displease with this laptop.I bought this laptop for business use, but unfortunately, the experience has left me with a bitter taste. The laptop does have some positive such as its hardware i5 and 8gb of ram, Its 9-hour battery life and average weight for being a 15.6 traditional laptop. Its ease of access to upgrade its HDD and ram, which I, of course, switch its HDD for an SSD. It's a disappointment when utilizing the hardware and it seems much more of a waste when basic things like the screen, keyboard, and touchpad are horrendous. Overall, I personally would not recommend this laptop, while the internals seems great, its executed in such bad matter that makes this laptop a disappointment.	3	6	2	8	3
So I’ve had this just about 3 weeks , I love it!!! Do yourself a favor get the 1050ti it really boosts this laptop. The ssd makes this thing boot up really fast and smooth, the i7 is new to me I use amd I’m very impressed with it. Gaming on this thing is nice I haven’t found anything that won’t run ultra I’m sure there is some but not many. I also just got into video editing and this really does a great job at it. The turbo boost fan keeps this running cold. Overall I’m in love with this laptop it’s lightweight battery if not gaming goes about 4 hours a little less gaming maybe a 1 hour time.	3	7	2	8	0

Mousepad is a PITA to work with. Touch screen is cool. If I'd known about all the mousepad sensitivity issues, sometimes too sensitive, and sometimes not working at all, I would have looked for a different computer.UPDATE: THIS COMPUTER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GOOGLE CHROME! The tabs don't have speakers on them to tell you which tabs are playing the music and if you have a lot of tabs open, the X is right in the middle of it. DON'T BUY!UPDATE 2: Just found another problem in Opera. DON'T BUY! I'm a computer programmer and T.I. specialist. I would know.UPDATE 3: Vivaldi Browser won't import bookmarks and settings from Google Chrome. It keeps saying that Chrome is still open, even though I rebooted and everything. Google search for symtpoms and solution returns open zero results.Consider yourself warned!	2	0	0	1	5
I purchased a refurbished chrome book and it arrived with a physically damaged screen. There are multiple scratches over a 4 inch area of the in the center of the screen. When powered on, a thin white line is present on the left side of the screen. Item is dirty, was not cleaned prior to shipping. Very disappointed.	2	1	0	0	4
Good laptop, all works fine. The only issue is Dell's approach. Small notebook 2 in 1 shouldn't be so heavy in 2018. Many minor things doing it less competitive to Asus and Mac than it could be. Weight, look, buttons...	2	6	3	3	3
BUYER BEWARE DO NOT PURCHASEI bought this for my cousin about 3 1/2 months ago and it's having problems with over heating and one of the fans (i think the CPU fan) has started making an obnoxious and loud grinding sound whenever it's running. I've looked around for solutions, everything from bios update and ec update, to new version of Dragon Center. Nothing has worked. This seems to be a recurring issue with this laptop and MSI has not given any significant solutions besides replacing the fan. But most people have the same issue soon after it's replaced. I understand hardware failing, but after only 3 months and it being this common? Come on MSI get your stuff together. DO NOT RECCOMEND. I've had better luck with my personal ROG laptop.	3	8	3	8	0
Little slower than I would have expected, but once you take the bloatware off the speed picks up considerably. The set up took 2 hours which is obnoxiously long and tell you the truth quite annoying. I usually buy ASUS products and will probably go back there for my next purchase. It is also feels cheaply made.It is ok, nothing special..	3	9	3	9	3
Perfect purchase for my needs which imclude e-mail, Amazon, sports, news and word processing. Can’t beat the price and quality for a low end lap top with Windows.	2	0	0	1	2
ASUS E200HA-UB02-GD Portable 11.6-Inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop 4GB RAM 32GB Storage, Windows 10, Aurora Gold. - The Chromebook competitor from ASUS is a winner. For under $200, ASUS has created a fairly powerful serious Windows 10 computer. My present workhorse laptop is a Lenovo Ultrabook IdeaPad Yoga 13 with an Intel I-5 chip (1.8 ghz) and this review will compare the two - the Asus is obviously smaller (by about 4 inches screen size) and less than half the weight - so its advantage is obviously where small size and weight is preferable to a bigger screen/keyboard/etc. My Lenovo runs Win 8.1 and the ASUS uses Win 10. I use Classic Shell on both (get it - it's free and lets you customize Win 8 or 10 to resemble XP or Win 7 menus). One note right away - most sellers sell the ASUS with just 2 GB, so stick to Amazon that has 4GB (I think that's really needed to power today's computers at a minimum). Now here's how the ASUS has done:I tried the ASUS with 4 web browsers (hate Edge, but IE11 is buried in there and can be used, and I also loaded Firefox and Chrome which run fine). I'm not a BING fan but switching search engines to Google isn't hard and I recommend that. I tried my old MSN mail dialup program (which is the old paid version of Hotmail) and it, along with Outlook, both did fine with Microsoft based mail. The ASUS came with a free year of Office 365 and that worked fine - I prefer the older versions of Word, etc., but a free year makes this $199 computer an even bigger bargain. I was also able to download my Corel Word Perfect/Office (Version 7) and it ran well too. I was able to open quite a few programs (all of the above) at once, with a total of about 15 separate browser windows open along with the mail and both word processors and the computer handled that. Web surfing and page loading was about as fast on the ASUS as on my Lenovo, a surprise, since the Lenovo is an i5 and the ASUS is a slower Atom chip, albeit a quad-core version. My gut says the ASUS will do fine for those who mainly web surf and do mail and word processing, but serious gamers will not have the power they need. But for a student or office work, this computer is a BARGAIN, and with it selling at a Chromebook price, it's an amazing deal.Two tips: While the touchpad was fine, I like mice, and a wireless mouse was a good addition. Also the computer is very limited on memory (32 GB, of which Windows and Office use much of that), so spend a few bucks and add a 128 GB microSD card (I did) and download files and less used programs there. There is a slot for the card.Plusses: It has a USB3 port and USB2 port, plus an HDMI port and speaker jack. It has a very good responsive keyboard with a great feel. And while the case has lots of plastic, it seems decently sturdy. The display is pretty good for an inexpensive one - not a rival for my Lenovo. The speaker is pretty loud for a small computer. It boots very quickly and setup was easy and fast and intuitive. The charger is very lightweight and it supports a fast charge protocol. I haven't fully hit the battery life because it's good - but going 9 hours didn't totally deplete it. The wifi connection supports a protocol my Lenovo doesn't so some websurfing may be faster than people used to surfing on older but more powerful laptops.Minuses: Another USB port or two would be nice, but it doesn't have but two. And for serious music, you'll want better speakers/headphones. And manual - well - it's a tiny piece of paper, so if you need details surf the internet, but that's typical for computers these days. And while I didn't slow it much on what I ran, true power users need more than the ASUS, but no $200 computer would meet that need.Biggest plus - under $200 - amazing power for that price. Even if you add Amazon's best deal on a memory card and grab a $7 mouse, with shipping you have a $225 deal. Not sure how they make money on it, but it's a steal. The gold color looks classy.	2	0	0	1	5

Great laptop. Even though it's only got one usb. It blew my LENOVO out of the water with the features and software included. Great stylish machine.	2	8	2	3	3
Great computer in many ways. But a proprietary charger instead of USB-C is beyond stupid. A second charger will cost an obscene $80.	2	7	2	3	3

This laptop is the absolute worst Amazon purchase I’ve ever made. It took several hours to run the program set-up process, the touchpad is not response at all, downloading files takes an extremely long time, and it has frozen about four times since I started using it about an hour ago. Also, battery life is terrible! I’ve used it for some internet browsing and and excel work and the battery percentage has gone from 100% to 82% over the course an hour. I cannot believe that Lenovo makes such a poorly crafted product. I would not recommend this product even if it meant you had to use grid paper to perform calculations and an ancient typewriter to type. Big time thumbs down.	3	0	0	8	2
Great little laptop, nice screen resolution and fast processor. My only issue is it only has one USB plug and no SD card slot	2	8	2	3	3
Last I checked, my new computer was due to arrive tomorrow 7/6 and was delighted to see it come in the mail a day early on 7/5. It was packaged very securely. No damage could have possibly happened while it was being shipped. It's in perfect condition as described and set up was really easy. It came with a free trial for Microsoft Office, which is awesome.I am a 31 year old mom, college student, and writer. I wanted something small and lightweight that I could bring with me in the living room for when I'm cramming in last minute homework or find inspiration for my novel, but don't want to leave my family to work on any of it. It's really perfect for that purpose. I haven't had a chance to explore what else I will find it useful for, but I am guessing it will be tons of things.Set up was really simple. It was out of the box at 2:14 and by 2:25 I was beginning my typical 'new computer downloads', like Chrome and all of that.Also, the color looks like a dull blue in the photo, which I wasn't pumped about, but it's really a bright fun blue and I like it a lot. In contrast with the bright white keyboard it looks really sharp.For this price, the product is more than I expected. Highly recommend.	0	9	0	1	4

As the keyboard, ease of updating, and computer speed are very important characteristics for a computer, I opted to reset the HP to factory condition and returned it, and ordered the Dell Inspiron 1550 instead.I needed to replace two ASUS laptops that were manufactured back when they had a well-earned reputation for keyboard and display 'issues.' My partner wanted the Dell Inspiron 1550, and I thought I'd try this HP being half a pound lighter and except for the fingerprint scanner on the Dell, had the same processing power. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like the more lightweight laptop, it was simply junk compared with the Dell which was only about $20 more expensive. The display on the HP was grainy, the Dell HD. The HP has a mic, the Dell has stereo mics. Dell has a great fingerprint scanning option, the HP did not. The keyboard on the Dell had easy to read and well-spaced keys, with or without the backlight. The HP's keys were difficult to distinguish from one another, with the light from underneath being brighter than the keys, and very narrow spacing between them.Last, the breaking point that had me stop setting up the HP, was that with each required update, the Dell was consistently twice as fast and each update was easily accomplished. Several updates on The HP, for some reason, kept completely failing, requiring extra hours for the update.	3	6	2	8	3
Fast and affordable!!	3	7	2	3	3
Good all around laptop for the money. Well built and easy setup. The i5 intel processor is speedy, but the start up sequence takes longer than it should. The fingerprint feature is pretty neat, but doesn't always work. Overall a good laptop that I would buy again.	3	6	2	8	3
"All things considered it is a very nice laptop. The build quality is good, the screen is good and the keyboard also. In general everything ""just works"" which is exactly what I wanted. I'm not sure if the claimed 22hours of battery life is possible under linux but it certainly does well over 14 because at one point I had it running for about that long thinking it was powered up and then discovering that the wall socket wasn't switched on.I bought this expecting to be forced to run Windows 10 on it - which wouldn't be terrible but was not what I wanted. To my pleased surprise when I tried to install Xubuntu 17.10 it installed flawlessly and the upgrade shortly afterwards to 18.04 was equally painless.I have kept w10 on it too to dual boot and w10 works fine too. The upgrade to the latest w10 version was also problem free."	2	5	2	3	3
"I purchased from a different big box store but I wanted to post my review here as most people come here first.Just a quick non in-depth but semi informative review :)First off, build quality on this is very nice and solid and the screen is amazing - not that you can really take full advantage of that resolution on such a small screen. The ""recommended"" resolution looks very good though. The pen worked well but I honestly didn't go too in depth with it. It worked as I would expect having owned phones from their Note series.Performance - Ehhh. Definitely a tad sluggish when in the play store and running android apps. I found that I had to exit out of chrome in order to do anything on the android side of things. What can you really expect from a core M3 though? I think for the most part, your average computer user should be fine with this. Also, if you do decide to go full on highest resolution with this, alot of the android apps arent going to work. Just a heads up.I had the laptop for 3 days, and every day it would reboot out of no where a few times. This may or may not be a software issue. This has been known to happen on several other chromebooks so take it as you will. I dont have the patience to wait it out so I returned it and grabbed a TabPro S (Completely different beast, I know)Battery Life in the 3 days I had it lasted about 8 hours on a charge.Oh and one more thing... Before you open the lid on the laptop make sure you take the plastic off that is on the hinge or it will make a loud cracking sound like you just broke something :)"	1	1	0	1	4
Great gaming laptop for the money. I'll start out saying i really only play World of Warcraft and a few simple games on steam, but for that purpose, I've found only minor faults with this machine. Wow runs smoothly even in new areas with dense player load, but this is on a custom setting i use that's below ultra but above middle of the road. Pros: great performance for the money, looks good, solid build quality, decent battery. Cons: sound quality through stock speakers is lackluster, keyboard lighting features are basically nonexistent, 1050ti already technically outdated, but solid for the price point, cooling fan is a bit loud. I realize it may sound like im beating up on a computer i gave 5 stars, but I could not find something better for the price.	3	6	3	3	0

"This has been a fine laptop, for 6 months. At this point, the hinge for the screen disconnected from the base of the laptop as shown in the images. The hinge then pushed the keyboard up and away, breaking plastic clips in the process. I am understanding of occasional hardware failures, but Dell is claiming that the failure is not covered under warranty, as it is ""Accidental Damage"". This is a $239 repair for an almost new laptop."	3	7	3	3	0

Bought this computer this month got it the first week of March and the screen is already cracked. I'm not sure what happened but I have only used it a couple of times and this happens. I'm not sure what to do. It's not very usable with a cracked screen and it cost too much money to just get another computer. I've had several computers and never had a screen crack!	3	6	3	3	0

For its price, one of the best option out there. What concerns me are the cramped keyboard layout and sturdiness of its screen cover. It's keys are small and non-standard while the screen cover, a press will feel like a space between the cover & led screen.	3	3	1	8	3
**COIL WHINE? LOOK**Reduced the coil whine tremendously by setting my wallpaper to solid black, and changing battery settings from 'performance' to 'balanced'; it still screeches from time to time but it's not as loud as it was before. Hope it helped you!It's an amazing laptop, beautiful and very powerful for how thin it is. I use it for music production via Fruity Loops and some light gaming like CS:GO and LoL. The only problem I have with it is the EXTREMELY loud coil whine. It got to the point where it annoys the hell out of me. I can hear it even if I'm playing music fairly loud or have a lot of background noise going on. Wish there was a fix for it.. otherwise it would've definitely been a 5/5.EDIT** I can't stand the coil whine. Nasty screeching staticy noise even while just web browsing. It's NOT the fan; top left of the computer.Find it freezing at times randomly in applications as well. Would return it but I don't have the time to wait because of work and school. Wish I went with something else..But if it weren't for the noise, this would be perfect. Exterior quality is superior along with a very nice display. Pretty sturdy keyboard too.EDIT***: FIXED... kinda	2	6	5	4	3
Just got the little machine and the weight is great and size is very thin. Was very hopeful the experience was going to continue.Then I turned it on. As usual these vendors put on bloatware and other stuff that make it, for most novices, impossible to use. I first had to start by disabling an Intel PPT Re-certification process that was consistently taking up 40-80% of the CPU. Still need to look into how to properly turn this off because it starts up on reboot via some service. Updates for Win10 Build 1709 were not coming down either (though most likely a Windows issue). In the end I had to rebuild the machine with Win10 1709 I have available on USB.I shudder to think what a novice would do with this machine. One nice little app though... Acer Care Center allowed me to easily backup the factory build and drivers.	2	0	0	1	2

If you're looking for a Macbook alternative, the Surface line is the go to option. This laptop has incredible build quality and feels like a tank. The hinge is perfectly tuned so you can open it with one hand, but still stiff enough to not wobble when using the touchscreen.Even though it's using last years 7th generation processor, in 2018, this is still a fine laptop. It handles most everything I can throw at it with ease, only slowing down with numerous apps open and >20 chrome tabs.If you get the machine with Windows 10 S, upgrade to Pro right away. It's free.Screen quality is top notch. Colors are vibrant, and it's bright enough to see outdoors. It also gets dim enough to use at night in bed, which not all laptops can do. The keyboard is excellent, much much better than the atrocity that is the 2016+ Macbook's. Battery life is excellent as well, ranging between 7-10 hours depending on what I'm doing.All in all, a great laptop. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for.	2	7	2	3	3
The only thing you should worry about this small laptop is disk capacity which is 32GB. It took me about 12 hours to upgrade to the new version of Windows 10. That's why I had to return it. Acer should have made it 64GB.Other than that, the screen is perfect, sharp and clear full HD, battery life is fantastic, I took it to the library and most of the time I was watching videos from youtube and still it lasted like 4 hours and another 4 hours were left.It's very light, keyboard is OK, Wifi is lightning fast and problem free.I just upgraded to a new and more expensive one but still it's Acer.So, if your budget is limited and you think you can live with 32GB disk(you know you can always attach a microSD anyway) this laptop is probably the best laptop on the planet with that price tag.	2	0	0	1	2
Starting off this computer is just great, the look the performance, everything. But after only a week I started getting major alerts and blue screens demanding attention. Now this would scare a lot of people off and for good reason; however, if you know literally anything about computers you can easily work around or even FIX them with relative ease. This computer can run Overwatch at 120 fps and dark souls 3 at 90 so over all I would say this computer is way way way worth it!	3	8	3	8	0
I've been using this as my main laptop over the past nearly 4 months, and it's the best laptop I have ever had. I am looking forward to the Android 7.1.1 update, resizable Android app windows, better Android apps support provided by Google (4K video editing, photo editing, etc), hopefully also some performance improvements through firmware updates (also Type-C SD card to Type-C HDD file transfer speeds), one thing's for sure, Chrome OS devices always get better over time, of course as long as your display, keyboard or battery doesn't somehow break. Mine works great still after those 4 months of heavy use. Now for sure it's not super cheap, that's why I think it would be great if Samsung could lower the retail price to about $349, then I really think it should be a no brainer. And I cannot understand why Samsung doesn't sell this laptop in Europe, I had to ship it from B&H to the UK.	1	1	0	1	4
This is my third chromebook. I did a lot of research before buying this one & I am very pleased with it. I don't use the touch screen or flip the screen like I thought I would though. It runs perfectly though & holds a battery for a long time. I would definitely recommend this computer.	1	1	0	1	4

This was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law. The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish (no scratches or markings) and seemed to work well for about the first month and then she started having problems with two of the keys on the keyboard sticking. It doesn't make it unusable, it's just frustrating to her, otherwise I would have given it five stars.	3	1	0	0	2

I bought this laptop for software development, it is great. I never experienced the issues other people experience. It just worked as expected.My project is one time project, I would not buy an expensive laptop. As long as it has 1050 GPU, it would work for me.Anyway, as a normal laptop, it worked and the laptop is pretty cool for a software developer.	3	7	3	8	0
For the price of 800 dollars this laptop is pretty good and easily up-gradable fyi the only things that can be upgradable is the ram, ssd, and if you want to you can install a hardrive.	3	7	3	3	0

Features that wow:Price vs value equation due to discrete Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processorUpgraded i7 Kaby Lake with less heat, lower power consumptionFast boot with 128 G SSD hard driveGood screen with low light leakageRed backlit full size keyboard with number padUnderstated styling (low bling), but enough to be happyBright TN screenRelatively solid build, soft touch plasticsLow fan noise even under loadRelatively low weight at 5 lbsFeatures that are less impressive:Plastic everywhereSound is averageDell is not known for making its own Dell branded computer gaming powerhouses—for that you have to jump up in price and bling to Alienware. With Dell’s dedicated Alienware brand you get lots of bells and whistles, including molded style metal cases, very solid builds, full lighting controls, generally nice specs and higher prices. Why change near mid cost perfection with the same case and essentially same innards as the prior i7559 build? This current computer is almost the same with the better Kaby Lake chip set and mostly the same Nvidia GTX1050 (vs GTX 960m). Styling wise the Inspiron is not Alienware, but with some nice red accents on the rear facing under screen grill and a red Dell logo on the lid, the Inspiron distinguishes itself as not your father’s Dell. [Full disclosure, having owned and upgraded from the prior Alienware M11X R3 laptop along with an i7559, I do love Alienware laptops.]First, Kaby Lake intel i7 chipset represents one of the best solutions to lower heat, lower power consumption with higher performance than the prior generation. Same for the Nvidia GTX1050—which performance wise during gaming, produces less heat and uses less power for similar performance (if not slightly higher in actual use!) than the prior equivalent graphics processer GTX960. This means that a gaming laptop can be built without it being a vacuum cleaner or jet engine for heat control at load. The current Kaby Lake i7 chip is highly acceptable and powerful enough to run just about anything you can toss.The 128 G SSD comes loaded with Windows 10 and it is suggested to jump immediately to updates at Microsoft and Dell for the latest drivers. [I moved immediately to W10-Creators and had no issues.] I was hoping that under the rear screw panel there might be room for removal of the 1T disc based 5200 RPM HD for replacement with an SSD, but no such luck. I suppose it could be done but it was not turnkey like a couple of prior iterations of this same laptop case. Startup is quick with the main operating system on the 128G SSD, at less than 30 seconds under normal circumstances. The 1T hard drive operates acceptably with Steam game files and other data in place.So Kaby Lake i7 and Nvidia GTX1050 is a perfect lower cost, lower heat alternative and partner with improvements over prior Skylake – GTX960 combo? Yes it is. No, it is not a GTX1060-70-80, each with progressively faster game frame rates, and higher quality settings during gaming, but most will find the 1050 a good alternative to higher prices. Gamers should and would question if the GTX1050 will play the games they want to play—and the 1050 may have limits depending on the game. For the games I play the most, I can report full functionality with high settings and Physix running on high settings for all the Borderlands series games, Fallout 4, and DOOM on this capable Dell Inspiron. While I cannot report on actual FPS, there is no obvious slowdowns in full action movement for these games. This laptop does like to be plugged in for game play at these levels, which I am used to from prior laptops. If you are not plugged in, you may have some movement and frame rate stutters in more demanding games at higher settings. The Nvidia 1050 provides low heat output at load. This Dell runs quiet with no audible fan noise at normal loads and tasks. When pushed during gaming the fan is audible but is very quiet so you would not necessarily need headphones during game play.The keyboard itself is good with a bit of play and solid feeling but no noticeable flex. Not mechanical but adequate. It is friendly to gaming and touch typing with full size keys and a nice number pad. Red LED lighting can be turned off or dimmed.The 15.6-Inch FHD TN screen has wide viewing angles, is very bright, and good color representation. As an improvement over the prior 7559 version, this sample does not have any border light leakage.Mouse pads are a sore point with many. The use of single surface pads is happening more and more, and often a source of issues. Having a work based ThinkPad, with a mostly unusable integrated pad, I always jump to a dedicated mouse. The Dell Inspiron’s pad is a bit better with mostly positive and separated sections for “right/left” buttons—although the offset may not appeal to all. Of course, if you are buying this laptop for gaming, you are already going to use a dedicated mouse.Sound quality is acceptable with good stereo separation, although the subwoofer is certainly not earthshaking. Strangely enough, out of the box, some diagnostic work was required and drivers had to be reinstalled due to no sound. Admirably, Windows made this simple with a quick restart.So, should you buy this laptop? Personally, for the games I play and the tasks I do, this is a great laptop for the price, albeit not “perfect” . You should consider what games you may play and read additional reviews regarding the suitability of the Nvidia GTX1050 for your own uses prior to jumping to any system that has similar specs. Great value and recommended.	3	8	3	8	0
"I received this laptop quickly on a Tuesday, by Friday I had to return it. After updating and setting everything up I kept getting an error message ""application blocked from accessing graphics hardware"" whenever I would try to watch a video, which then would crash the computer. I searched online to try to find a fix including uninstalling/reinstalling drivers and more to no avail. The Amazon product assistance said it was probably a hardware issue and issued a refund."	2	2	3	3	6
Nice, comfortable laptop. Haven't used it much yet, but allready seems to be an outstanding purchase.	3	6	2	8	3
Beware the plug on the side of this computer. If you're the type to sit the laptop like a desktop & leave it there, you'll love this thing. Don't take it from room to room or travel with it, though - the side pin is flimsy & keeps popping out. Now it's broken; I bought a new plug for it and it keeps popping out too. I need to take this laptop to get it fixed but since I use patient information, I need to protect the files - so that means backing everything off. THEN, I get to sit this on the desktop and buy another new computer (NOT an MSI) that's more sturdy. At the end of the day, double the cost for what could have been the answer to my issues of speed & power to do what I need to do. I'll stick with Lenovo, I guess - they certainly hold up better. I also don't like the hard drive separation - who's bright idea was that? I have to remember to look in the D drive vs. the usual C drive. Yep, I'll stick with Lenovo - for the same price, I'll get a more sturdy machine & I won't need to deal with the cord.	3	8	3	8	0

The computer itself is great but not straight out of the box.This is my 2nd laptop from Lenovo and it had all the same problems as the first one did. CPU running high, HDD staying at 100%. So when I got my 2nd laptop I plugged in my Win10 bootable flashdrive and performed a clean installing of Windows and then I installed all updates, BIOs, and drivers. I then installed my own antivirus software and that immediately fixed my HDD staying maxed out because it was due to Windows Defender. My only dislikes is that it uses Seagate HDD and Samsung memory chip. Every Seagate HDD that I've owned which is a lot has all failed and I hate all Samsung products because all have failed for me in laptops, tv's, and phones. Western Digital HDD is what I like and never had one fail. My other dislike is that I have to remove the complete back panel to gain access to the HDD or memory. I like it better when it has a small quick access panel for this. I only recommend this laptop to Tech's and not the average users due to Windows 10 problems.	3	2	1	8	7
I've only had this a week, but it's been a great week. I've used this laptop for writing reports, email, web browsing, minor photo editing, and wordpress development. It's worked perfectly for all of those tasks, with no slowdown that I've noticed at any time. Battery life is excellent, with around 10 hours of actual use, and very good standby battery life.The only issues I've had are 1) keyboard - the keys are just a bit . . . different. Sometimes I think that I hit a key, but it doesn't register. This mostly happens when I'm typing longer emails or I'm not paying as much attention. If I focus on my typing, it's not an issue. 2) Fan - the CPU fan comes on even during low intensity tasks like web browsing. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. I wish it were quieter, but it's really not a big deal. For how smooth everything runs, I gladly take the fan noise. And 3) the left USB port doesn't work with my wireless mouse. The right USB port works, and the left USB port works with everything else I've tried, including a USB hub and a thumb drive. Not sure what the issue is there, but I just use the right port.I would definitely buy it again, and I think it's a great device for the price.	2	5	2	3	4

Overall, the laptop works well while having an appealing design -- however, there are many different factors that will make you hate this computer. First, the graphics are terrible -- even with Intel integrated graphics, the computer cannot manage to perform tasks that are simple in terms of graphical demand. While the computer can run videos on YouTube, it cannot manage to run Netflix (I have 150mbps, so it is not due to my internet connection). The image usually appears extremely blurry, and there is nothing you can do to resolve this issue. Secondly, the speakers sound average at best, but the major issues are due to the speaker's location, which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight, solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear. Thirdly, the battery life is terrible -- if I'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer, the battery is dead within 1-3 hours. Lastly, if you are into gaming, this computer fails in every category. Obviously, this computer is not designed to handle gaming, but playing games that are very basic, two dimensional, and primitive can barely run. On the plus side, this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs (Word, PowerPoint, email, small projects, video chat).To reiterate, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Lightweight- Attractive Design- Performs Small Application Very Well- Light-Up Keyboard- Easy-To-Type Keyboard- Can Handle Programming- Overall Reliable- Thin DesignCons:- Highly Overpriced- Fails To Run Many Applications- Bad Battery Life- Graphics Are Terrible And Replacing The Graphics Card Will Not Help Much (It Is The Computer Itself)- Cannot Be Used For Entertainment Purposes (Netflix, Gaming)	3	7	2	8	4

I upgraded from an older Acer tablet/laptop hybrid (Aspire model). It was good but I needed something more powerful and with better battery, etc. This Samsung Chromebook is just what I was looking for. I do pretty much all my work in the cloud - so running MS Windows-based programs is not necessary for me on mobile. I do have a PC with MS Windows that I still use for certain applications.PROS:1. Display quality is amazing. I'm sure this is because it's a nice upgrade for me but - unless on the beach in the sun - not sure the highest brightness level will ever be necessary.2. It just works - well. Speedy, efficient and quite simple.3. Light and durable in construction.4. The included stylus is a great added feature. The handwriting in Evernote/similar seems to work very well.CONS:1. Keyboard keys are a little tight (very minor complaint).2. As I saw others mention, the trackpad isn't fantastic but it seems to work well.Overall a great buy in my opinion!	1	1	0	1	4

I use my computer for surfing the web and emails. Clearly this machine can do much more. It's light weight and the keys have a good feel to them.	3	6	2	8	3
I bought this for school, as I'm a high school student. It worked OK with Google docs. It's slower than I'm used to (paid $200, what do ya expect). But it did do what I needed if I didn't have another computer accessible.Right now, I have an issue with it not actually finding WiFi. This is probably a one off problem only I'm having, but it's still causing issues regardless. If you need a computer like this, go for it. But I recommend an HP stream or equally-priced chromebook if you want something bigger, and a chromebook if you really only use Google Apps (docs, chrome, etc.)But let's hop in the specifics. It has a front facing camera, USB Ports, micro HDMI and a charging port (not USB-c, if that's what you wanted). The trackpad isn't nice, and neither is the loading speed and stock storage, but it does manage to hold a charge pretty well and it's decent for typing and light streaming for videos. And while it's not metal, it looks beautiful (but does have a few scratches, but I'm rough on everything).And I want to take a scratch second and tell you - it's lightweight. I ride a bike to school, coming in at under 2.5lbs (2.2 if I'm correct) it's perfect as I need something light (a heavier backpack messes up shoulders a bit more when jumping around curbs).Summary: OK for school, not much else. Right now it's a paperweight on my desk while I troubleshoot WiFi issues.I do want to say I bought this with my dad's account, in order to get cheap 2-day shipping. I also want to say I typed this on my cellphone. Sorry!	2	0	0	1	5

"A tad slow for internet searches, even on cable. I use it as for streaming audio or as a lightweight laptop when traveling. So still worth the price so far. Have had it about a month. Pleased with my previous Asus netbook -- five years for a bit more than $300, and my current ASUS 17"" laptop is toodling along after 3+ years so overall, I am pleased with the brand. But . . . I mostly use these for web surfing and writing. No big image files, no gaming."	2	0	0	1	5
This computer DOES NOT WORK WITH ANY HEADSET/MIC. Per Tech Support, if it uses a headphone, it cannot also use a mic. RIDICULOUS! DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WILL EVER WANT TO USE A HEADSET/MIC!	2	7	3	8	3
I purchased the item NEW from an Amazon 3rd party supplier but the Samsung box arrived very dirty and scuffled. The overall design appears to be quite good but product build quality is somewhat questionable. The unit I received had problem reading the microSD card and the trackpad was not well assembled since it made an annoying rattle when I touch it with my finger. Interestingly, there was also a tiny smudge of glue/dirt on the top of the chromebook right out of the box which didn't seem right. As for design, the screen, keyboard, battery life and software are quite satisfactory for the asking price. The (perceived) speaker volume and acoustic is not very loud so you do need to set it at 75% most of the time. I'm returning my unit for now and might buy it again in a few months when hopefully the manufacturing quality improves.	1	1	0	1	4

Would give zero stars if I could. I used this computer only about 5 times since I purchased it at the end of July. It has been stored in an air conditioned home under optimal conditions.

If you're looking for a Macbook alternative, the Surface line is the go to option. This laptop has incredible build quality and feels like a tank. The hinge is perfectly tuned so you can open it with one hand, but still stiff enough to not wobble when using the touchscreen.Even though it's using last years 7th generation processor, in 2018, this is still a fine laptop. It handles most everything I can throw at it with ease, only slowing down with numerous apps open and >20 chrome tabs.If you get the machine with Windows 10 S, upgrade to Pro right away. It's free.Screen quality is top notch. Colors are vibrant, and it's bright enough to see outdoors. It also gets dim enough to use at night in bed, which not all laptops can do. The keyboard is excellent, much much better than the atrocity that is the 2016+ Macbook's. Battery life is excellent as well, ranging between 7-10 hours depending on what I'm doing.All in all, a great laptop. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for.	2	8	2	3	3
DO NOT BUY!!! I first bought the laptop from BestBuy and at first I really liked the laptop. However in the second week of ownership the speakers kept making a buzzing and chirping noise, the metal got all scratched up (even in case(somehow)) and then the touch screen stopped working all together. Samsung wanted $50 if they did a diagnostic and found that it wasn't under warranty (not including how much to fix it). I was lucky and BestBuy swapped it out for me free of charge. Now the new laptop somehow is even more scratched up and scratched up deep. Bought another case for it but does not allow full 180 bend. Would not recommend product. Even thought the screen is amazing and it does run android apps pretty well, Samsung missed its mark on build quality and unfortunately makes me question buying another Samsung product. I really wanted to like this product.	1	1	0	1	4
I got this as a gift for taking an expensive class. It looks like the replacement for last year's entry model for the i5, 4gb/128gb memory. Based on the reviews from last year's model, this notebook has improved with 8gb memory and has an Intel 7300u cpu. While the cpu upgrade is welcomed, I wish it has the 8th gen 4 core/8 thread coffee lake cpu instead. It looks like it has the same toshiba 128gb ssd as last year. I didn't run any benchmarks, but it is zippy enough. The laptop also comes with Windows 10 Pro instead of the Windows 10 S.This notebook is definitely premium looking with its aluminum chassis and the keyboard is very comfortable to type. This notebook is quiet most of the time but makes a funny but not loud noise when the fan is in full throttle. 2 major gripes of this notebook is the lack of expanandability as this notebook has 1 usb port, no sd card slot and you can forget about servicing this notebook as this notebook is not meant to be taken apart. So you can't even replace the battery without potentially damaging the notebook.	2	8	2	3	3

This is an excellent little machine. I kept my eye on it for a while and watched the other reviews - if you're on the fence, and you're looking for an excellently light travel laptop that can run Office while you're on the road without breaking the bank, go for it. I'm impressed with the processing speed and the battery life is ridiculous - I ran all my updates/cleanup/installs of new apps and used it for about 3 hours a day for three days before it hit 20%. Keyboard and screen are decent quality for the price, and it handled all the uninstalling and Windows updating like a champ. Also, this is purely aesthetic, but in some of the other comments there were notes on the color...mine is definitely a light gold, no silver sheen. It looks classy, runs great,, and is so light I don't even know it's in my bag - perfect for long work trips. For the price and specs this is an excellent buy, and I am a happy Asus convert from the super-expensive and cheaply made HP options in this range.	2	0	0	1	5
Got this as workstation and as a gaming device, to replace my now aging desktop pc. I could have updated the CPU, motherboard, memory and video card, and get another desktop, but just the video cards nowadays cost about 1200 dollars; so the thing was not feasible, and went for a laptop; in the meantime that prices go back to normal.The whole thing is solid; heavy; and give you a great feel of being resilient when you use it. The trackpad is decently sized and works fine; although it is not super precise, but I use the laptop mostly as desktop replacement, connected to wireless mouse and keyboard.The LCD screen is pretty nice and bright; refresh rate is great; and works fine for most of the activities; but I have the laptop connected to a bigger monitor on my desk, so I don't use it all the time. Colors are pretty bright and vivid; took a bit to calibrate it but then you can let it be and enjoy it.The keyboard is awesome; I feel very comfortable typing on it; and the resistance and spacing of the keys is perfect for me (I have big hands); I still make mistakes because the layout of the keyboard on the right side is not the same as a standard PC keyboard; but once you remember that the delete key is right on top of the backspace, and that the enter key is not as big as it was, then it is a breeze. Plus it has a ton of light settings; not a fan of flashy ones, but the red hue is quite nice.CPU and GPU works great; got some awesome results from 3dsmax, Visual Studio and other Adobe apps like Photoshop and Dimension; which made me very happy, since the main usage of this computer is portable graphic workstation. Unity works great too, and with 16 GB of RAM, you have plenty to run concurrent and memory-intensive apps.SSD is small; and it is weird since it is a raid made of 2x128 GB M2 drive; but it works fast and it is fine for me. The computer has a 1 TB mechanical drive, which won't win any contest for speed, but it is reliable and awesome to have inside the computer, to store large amount of data.The computer comes with a DVD combo drive, which can be swapped for an extra fan; I did ditch both and got an extra caddy to put an extra SATA SSD drive; and the process was painless. Now I have 2 TB of storage plus the 256 GB of system drive, and all without opening the laptop or buy external enclosures.Sound is OK; I didn't buy it for that, the internal audio card works as expected with headphones; and the internal speakers are quite loud and nice to listen to; but for movie watching, use your headphones.The fan is not that loud; not sure where you live, but in my office room, with everything else going on, I can't hear it at all, even when it is full throttle. I never got the laptop very hot, neither when playing games nor rendering in 3dsmax or working in Unity; so I guess I was lucky with the thermal compound job they did at the factory.Games run fast here; got Witcher 3 at max details and it runs smooth as silk; same for other games that are very demanding, like Tomb Raider. The scores for 3dmark are a bit lower than a desktop overclocked 1070 with an i7 8th gen; due to the fact that the laptop versions are usually clocked lower for power and heat management issues, but I won't loose my sleep for few frames lost. If you are a purist, get a desktop computer.Battery life is a joke, but this is a desktop replacement. The main issue is the lack of energy saving process, which would switch to the Intel onboard GPU, but this does not happen; the 1070 is always on and this means that the battery goes down fast (about 2.5 hours of usage, 50m if rendering). Plugged in, no problem, but if you plan to move around with this beast in tow; keep in mind that you need to be close to a plug most of the time (although in this case, you would get an ultra light model).Software onboard was not super intrusive; I did remove the extras I do not need; and left the Acer app, that is great for backup, restore and overall managing the computer drivers and get the info like serial number and such. W10 works just fine.It has 4 USB3 ports on the sides, and 1 USB-C Thunderbolt; so if you plan to use an external GPU one day, you can do so. Future proof is great.The other ports are the power connector; a SD card reader (always welcome to avoid to use a dongle), and a display port (full port, thank God) and a HDMI port, with the LAN port to guarantee connectivity at top speed. It has also a mic and headphone jack, which are also great.VR works great on this computer; the Rift runs smooth and nicely; setup was easy and also using external monitors works great (got an ultra-wide screen connected to it).In conclusion; great specs, decent price for what you get, and VR ready; perfect as game machine and as workstation; can't really complain much about anything.	4	7	5	8	0
PROS:+ I'm in love with the chassis texture which is nice to touch and hides oil stains to a degree (see Cons)+ Comfortable humanized keyboard, plus full numpad, makes touch typing a breeze+ Speedy SSD with cold boot times of less than 10s (see Neutrals)+ Screen boasts a number of comfortable viewing angles (see Neutrals)+ Removable battery with decent life--a single full charge will yield close to 7 hours for normal computing tasks and up to 5 for watching videos/movies+ Fan is whisper quiet when it kicks onNEUTRALS:* Skimpy storage at only 128GB (250GB would've been much better without pushing the cost much higher), but I guess there's still plenty of room if you're a cloud-happy consumer* Half-size left/right arrow keys--which is a bummer for me since I often use keyboard shortcuts which include those arrow keys and sometimes find myself hitting empty space* Ultra-low profile keys with minimal travel, though it does still have that satisfying click as you type, which require acclimation if you're coming from higher profile keys or mechanical keyboard* No backlighting on the keyboard--I know it doesn’t say anywhere that it has this feature, but it doesn’t say that it doesn’t either...I’m just making it extra clear for the curious* While the screen has several nice viewing angles, the colours can get a bit washed out and, depending on what you're doing, images aren't crisp (not the point that it renders this laptop unusable, but it may be problematic if you do a lot of photo/video editing/viewing)* This thing takes its time to recharge requiring upwards of 3-4 hours for a full recharge from 10%* Speakers are what you'd expect from a laptop and get even muddier when you kick up the volume--that said, this is a Neutral rather than Con as this seems to be an area most laptops fail miserably inCONS:- Trackpad and keys are a little too eager to absorb the oils from your fingers/hands, and while it's less visible on the textured chassis, it's still there and slightly more difficult to clean up- Speaking of the trackpad, straight out of the box it was incredibly sluggish and imprecise (i.e. you could be sliding your finger across it, but the mouse stubbornly refuses to move)--I dug around and found the Dell trackpad settings which helped somewhat, though not much- If you hope to install a bit more memory (which you’ll want to do if you’re a heavy multi-tasker), or even swap out the SSD for a larger/faster one, you’ll discover firsthand how needlessly painful it is to remove the rear panel- This is one hefty beast, not bad if you're keeping it on a desk, but could be annoying if you must lug it around daily- The never-ending bloatware is brutal, mostly due to Microsoft, especially if you set up multiple accounts (it's like zombie software just pops up out of nowhere despite having uninstalled it from the Admin account)NOTES:This is not a gaming machine and never will be no matter how much memory or storage you throw at it. But for the price this isn’t a bad starter machine. You don’t need to add anything in order to have a spry little workhorse. It may, however, be lightweight for a business machine (unless your business doesn’t go beyond emailing, writing a few memos, and basic blogging).I’m almost tempted to compare this with my Acer E5-575-33BM, but won’t because these laptops are in slightly different leagues. This one is much more lightweight feature-wise though similarly spec’ed. Not to mention, it’s faster than the stock Acer.This is a great choice if you have a kid still in school or heading off to college (or if you’re heading off to college yourself) and you want a no fuss no muss laptop that will get the job done. That said, if you don’t mind investing another hundred dollars to have a mini powerhouse, then I’d recommend getting the Acer plus memory and SSD upgrades. (I’ll leave my link to the review in the comments.)Over time I may update this review to add or note any significant changes. If, however, you have any questions before then about the product or my experiences with it, please leave a comment and I’ll do my best to answer.	3	4	0	2	3

Although I do 90% of my technology on my phone, I do have a few things that require a PC to do. Some things are just easier to type or do on a laptop than mobile device. I had previously got a Chromebook, but there are many programs and functions that I need that were not compatible. The main hurdle I have faced lately is using my husband's laptop to use my Cricut for new downloads and projects because my Chromebook would not run it. This worked great for SVG and font files and synced flawlessly with my Cricut. From the moment I opened the box, I was pleased to find a shiny new laptop. It was actually a little bigger than I was expecting at the price point, but I was glad to see the keyboard boasted a number pad which is lacking on many laptops. Once I opened it, plugged it in and turned it on, I was greeted by a Cortana, Microsoft's version of Siri. She walked me through the set up process and I was online within minutes. The TB hard drive is a nice asset for a computer in this price point. The screen was okay but not fabulous. If you are looking for a high powered gaming computer, you may be disappointed, but I found it very appropriate for all tasks that I need it for. I would definitely recommend it for as a solid find at this price point.	3	3	1	8	3
Keyboard stopped working after a couple of weeks. I searched online and apparently this is a common problem with Acer laptops. I’m still going through troubleshooting it before I return it, but it’s been more trouble than it’s worth. I knew a cheap laptop was a risk. Buy something a little more expensive and you won’t waste your time.	2	0	0	1	2

"Really great laptop.NOTE: i see everyone saying the screen is really bad, it really isn't. I suppose if you're coming from a IPS with great quality then maybe, but otherwise, the tn that this laptop comes with is good.Fans are quiet, don't even really turn on with general use. When gaming they spins but are almost unnoticable.I got 40fps in Skyrim at ultra settings and 36 FPS on Neverwinter at highest settings.ALSO if your browser sticks and goes unresponsive, turn off the ""Hardware Acceleration"" feature in the browser's settings."	3	7	3	8	0

I chose this Chromebook Plus for a variety of reasons, primarily the great display and the stylus. The Plus version is said to have a much better battery life than the yet to be released Pro. However I have a lot of issues with this thing being touted as Android ready. Every android app runs terribly and freezes continually. Overall the thing feels like a beta tester model, but I will have to reserve my 1 (or 5) star review for when Nougat releases.	1	1	0	1	4

I've had this laptop for a few months and I love it a lot. It boots up in seconds and makes it so easy to get on task faster. I take it with me to school and its light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying bricks. The battery lasts for 7 hrs and I usually dont charge it for two days bc I mostly use it for school work and only play one game on Steam. I don't really use it for heavy software, so I don't know how powerful it is for that.My main problem, though, is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two, or it will lag, but with my wireless mouse it's fine. It never lags or stops working. With the mousepad, I will try to right click but it will act like I intended to left click. It's frustrating, since I dont take my wireless mouse with me everywhere.Overall, I'm happy with it.	3	7	2	8	4

I have been using this Laptop for a week now and I feel it is really good value for money.The packaging was good, the look and feel is great, the 1920x1080p display renders crisp images. The pre loaded Windows 10, though this was something that I did not want, is nevertheless, quite quick to boot up.I have not run any benchmarking tests but don't see any problem with any of the regular applications.The two things that I have a complaint about :1. The mouse pad does not respond the way you want it. I don't know if there are any settings to change the feel, but the default settings leave a lot to be desired.2. The placement of the status LEDs. These are placed in the front edge of the laptop and hence are not visible to you during your normal working position !!! So, to check if the Caps Lock is on, you have to either bend down to look or tilt the laptop up to see the front edge .... What kind of UI design expert decides on these things, I wonder ?!	3	6	2	8	3
"Acer Predator 17 Gaming Laptop, Core i7, GeForce GTX 1070, 17.3"" Full HD G-SYNC, 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, G9-793-79V5The Acer Predator G9-793-79V5 is probably the best choice I made for a gaming laptop, I really was tempted to get an Asus ROG but after checking the specs between them I believe this one convinced me. Will try to be as detailed as possible.* THE GOOD:+ 17"" diagonal LCD IPS screen providing native 1920x1080 resolution.+ nVidia GTX 1070 graphics.+ Illuminated keyboard + keypad.+ Hotkey / macro profiles on the left side, switch button allows to store up to 15 macros+ OS very clean, not a lot of bloatware to complain of and the Acer utilities include a wi-fi analyzer which in turn allows to configure better wi-fi channels for better network performance.+ 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key SSD + 1Tb 7200 SATA HD.+ 16Gb RAM out of the box plus 2 easy access slots on the back for expansion.+ USB 3.0 ports layout is good, not spread all over and spaced nicely to connect multiple devices without blocking each other.* THE BAD:- Heavy and large but again its 17"" made for gaming or to replace a desktop so deal with it.- Proper gaming sessions require power brick connected, power brick rated for 230W output.- Quick start guide very simple instructions, you actually need to download the manual to learn most of its tricks.- 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key in RAID-0 configuration. (Read below)- Locked ""InsydeH20"" BIOS. (Read below)- Basic optical media, DVD reader / writer, my previous computer was an HP Pavilion dv6 and could read Blu-Ray discs.Let me give you my biggest beefs to a couple of the ""BAD"" things.* Having 2 SSD drives is a big bonus, but using them in a RAID-0 array its pointless, because they are SSD's, they are fast already and the RAID-0 gain in so minimal that the computer actually wastes time writing on 2 devices instead of 1.* This problem with RAID 0 is compounded due the fact that Acer decided to lock the BIOS so the SATA mode is set to RAID and preventing end users to change it. Again this is a major mistake. In the event of RAID array failure the user cannot reinstall software or may not recover at all since the configuration setting is locked.At this point some of you who know how to work with RAID-0 arrays may think. ""Surely that kind of problem is very rare.""Sadly it is not, before this review I received this same computer and while running it through its paces the RAID array failed.Because RAID was locked in BIOS I could not use an image I made at first and the Acer recovery tools and recovery management were unable to reinstall the software or rebuild the array from scratch.This also prevents users from upgrading to bigger SSD drive sizes, I am unaware of the RAID array will be rebuilt on a bigger SSD drive, plus the SSD slots and space for them may cause problem installing a new SSD. (See pictures)Acer really needs to unlock the BIOS and give the option to the users to configure the computer as they see fit and its not really that hard. After speaking with Acer support he claimed that users can unlock the BIOS but its not Acer's policy to disclose how to do it. So I assume the unlock procedure is just a backdoor or master password to unlock all features.Now a bit on the good side:This is a laptop computer but you want to use it on a table for comfort, when its running at full speed it gets warm BUT the lap portion remains relatively cool. Using the overclocking options the most heat came from the rear away from the lap and even away from the keyboard, even graphic-intensive games were run very smoothly at ""Ultra"" settingsIn the end I think the GOOD overcome the BAD and its a solid purchase for both work and entertainment for the next couple years and if Acer stops trying to tie leashes on the customers it will be a great purchase for everyone else.** 08/12/2017 A bit of more updates. **Around 1 month after I got the computer have used it to convert movies with handbrake and while all 4 cores work at full I see no extra heat coming out from the back, heat output remains at a steady 97F-98F.While people like to use test programs like heaven and others I prefer to use somewhat intensive applications.I run Second life at Ultra settings and Space Engineers online and they both run quite smoothly, very little (if any) visual lag.The most delays I notice is when using the SATA hard drive for the programs but using the SSD's pretty much prevents that.Still trying to get ACER to spit the BIOS backdoor/master password to unlock all features but no success so far.** 08/22/2017 More updates. **With the help from ACER predator forums I learned I could update from the 2x128Gb RAID-0 to a single 512Gb NVMe M.2 stick by removing both SSD's and placing the new one then restore a full backup upon the new drive so as not lose any existing data. (No need to make changes to BIOS except boot order)The process took 2 or 3 tries before getting it right but it worked, with the single NVMe drive the predator is not just fast.It flies!Loading time from Power-Up to Windows 10 login is 7 seconds flat.Afterwards I connected one of the remaining 128Gb sticks to the M.2 SATA connector and using Inter Rapid Storage GUI inside windows broke its RAID setting so I can use it instead to install programs on it.So now I have 3 drives:1x512Gb NVMe M.2 SSD stick.1x128Gb SATA M.2 SSD stick1x1Tb SATA 7200 HD."	4	7	5	8	0

Ive been using this for a day and at first the touchscreen with my fingers was a bit buggy and kinda still is but it is very responsive with the pen, however everything else is amazing.

This laptop is terribly made and has nonstop hardware issues right out of the box. I returned the first one I received because the battery refused to charge after 2 days and had to be plugged in 24/7. Tech support was unhelpful with this issue and thankfully Amazon's return policy still covered the laptop. The replacement worked perfectly until now, less than 5 months later, the headphone jack isn't working anymore and the left side of the screen gets covered in flickering blue lines, like very fine graph paper half of the time. I have not dropped the computer or gotten it wet. Very dissatisfied with the product. For the price (over $500) it should be built much more sturdily and should at least last a few years without major hardware isues. I can sometimes understand receiving one dud product but two in a row??? The only reason I give it two stars is because the performance and features are solid when the device actually works. I expected much better from ASUS.	3	6	2	8	3

This laptop has honestly been great. I got a good deal on it by buying it through Amazon Warehouse, but I think it would even be worth its full price.First off, I love the stylus. I do digital art so it's a great asset. I have a Wacom tablet as well, so I have a bunch of different s-Pens with different nib textures that work with this. There is something great about being able to draw right on the screen.The laptop is very snappy and the battery lasts forever. I love that it charges with USB-C. I do sometimes miss the USB-A port with things like my wired mouse or flash drive. This isn't a big deal, but you may need to get new Bluetooth mice, etc.Aesthetically, the aspect ratio is interesting. Sometimes it takes me a second to get accustomed to it after using other devices. It definitely has more usable space for websites, though. I also wish it was available in black like the Pro. I didn't need a more powerful machine so I just went with the Plus, even though I prefer the black color.I didn't think that I would care about not having a backlit keyboard, but honestly it's kind of annoying. I like to watch my laptop to fall asleep which means the screen is too dim to illuminate the keyboard. I just use it in tent or media mode, but then it's more difficult to adjust the screen brightness.Speakers are pretty underwhelming. I find that I need to the volume to be turned all the way up to hear anything.The keyboard is a little cramped. I have small hands so it doesn't bother me, but when I switch between normal full size keyboards and this one, my first few minutes of typing will have more errors and mistypes.The small backspace button doesn't bother me too much though.But all in all this is a great portable laptop. It does everything I need it to do. It definitely won't replace full function, high powered desktops and laptops. I have a gaming desktop and an old Macbook Pro to do the things that Chromebooks can't do.	1	1	0	1	4

Perfect laptop for students, especially you already own a powerful workstation. The device is light and thin. The screen ratio is different from many other laptops, but it works really fine for reading and coding. The color is amazing.The touch screen helps sometimes, but using surface pen on the laptop doesn't give good experience. The touchpad feels smooth and supports many gestures. WIndows hello is really handy and fast.One of the speaker of my device is flawed, but i got the compensation. Some people may need more USB ports.	2	8	2	3	3

I was skeptical at first but this computer is amazing! I had a prior Dell Inspirion and this is replacing it. I got many good years out of that computer. This computer was slow at first but I automatically went and removed all the bloatware of it, now it is blazing fast! I love the touchscreen and size of the screen. Overall, this computer has been great! I hope it lasts as long as my last Inspirion.. Great job Dell!Update after 3 months: Can’t complain with it at all, it has run fantastic after disabling all the bloatware and windows 10 services!	3	9	3	9	3

I wanted to like it. It has much going for it. It is small, portable, cheap and easy. Alas, you get what you paid for. It has minuscule memory. I got an SD card for it to boost its memory, and that helps with storage of data and apps. However, there is insufficient memory to download and install Windows Updates. There are a number of workarounds posted on the web, but so far I haven't been able to get any of them to work for me. Finally I just had to turn off the Automatic Windows Update so I could get any work done at all. I am shocked and saddened that HP and Microsoft haven't negotiated a fix for this yet. I still use it and I still like it, but not being able to load Windows Updates is a major issue, and had I known about it before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it.	2	1	0	1	7
Great laptop. Beautiful to look at. Light. As a business user, the keyboard travel is fantastic and the Alacantra skin makes it very comfortable to use. It's May 2018 and you can still upgrade free to Windows 10 Pro (thank heavens!). Very glad I did not buy another laptop.	2	8	2	3	3
This chromebook is very fast and a very long lasting battery life. The hardware is perfectly done. Feels very solid, very thin, light and premium. No flexes anywhere. The keyboard is really good too for the thinness of the laptop. It is important that you update your android apps regularly because its still in beta. The only problem i have is some android apps crash but after some updates they work great now. I would get this over ipad pro or macbook 12''.solid built quality, very light and thin.very beautiful retina screen same quality as new macbook pro.speed is very fast but make sure you update your android apps regularlybattery life is awesome around 10 hoursboot time is instantly vs slow boot time of mac os and windowstablet mode is same as any android and ipad tablet but the screen is much nicer on this samsung chromebook.chrome os is very fast, efficient, and simple, much better than mac os and windows	1	1	0	1	4

Since replacing her old laptop with this Lenovo I no longer hear my wife yelling in frustration. She is quite pleased with this one. She can enter grades online with ease now.

The keyboard is nicely arranged as well.	3	2	1	8	7
I purchased this laptop for $750 which at this point in time is a great deal. It came with Nvidia 1050ti graphics card which is good for 1080p gaming. 1050 would be a little too low in graphics power. Nvidia 1060 graphics card would be better but most laptops that carry one cost closer to $1000. Once you start reaching that high in price I’d start looking into gaming PC’s because you’ll get more bang for your buck.The hard drive I received was a Intel® SSD 600p. Which is a pcie nvme type ssd hard drive. These are faster then sata based ssd hard drives which are faster then older hdd drives. Laptop starts really fast thanks to hard drive and does virus scans faster too.Battery life is good. It can supposedly go up to 8.5 hours but seems to be more like 6 hours for regular non-gaming tasks with brightness at half and WiFi on. Keep in mind if you try gaming on battery it’ll only last about an hour or so.Overall I feel like this laptop is very well balanced at this price range that doesn’t cut corners on any of the things I value in a laptop. Hard to find a better deal for a gaming laptop that can also double as something to get work done on.	3	6	3	3	0

"This computer may lack some of the bells and whistles of less affordable models, but it is a workhorse. We are using it as the engine of a small recording studio, and it is handling its responsibilities well, literally not missing a beat. While our other laptops are lazily surfing the web or reading emails, the ASUS keeps up with the processing required to transform analog sound into digital data, juggling Adobe products as if they were beachballs. Right now, it's got various pieces of hardware plugged into it, including headphones, a mixer, and a microphone, and there are still ports to spare.Setting up the machine was fast and straightforward, and it's mercifully free of the bloatware that is too often packaged with lower end laptops. I haven't had a chance to test out some of the features, like the long battery life (it hasn't left the studio), but I like the fact that ASUS has nailed so many of the details, especially the keyboard. Most laptop keyboards seem to be tacked on as an afterthought ""guess we need one of these too?"" not the case with this model, with a keyboard that is solid and comfortable.Here in Silicon Valley, you don't see a lot of people sitting in coffee bars with an ASUS propped up next to their double lattes. It's not the latest or most fashionable me-too accessory. But if you're beyond needing to show how cool you are and simply want a laptop that gets the job done, the ASUS is ideal."	3	6	2	8	3

Bought it as a gift for someone. Really love the build quality and increased functionality due to Google Play being shipped out of the box. After using it for a little while, I have to say that I am not a fan of that keyboard as many others have mentioned. The layout feels a little odd due to it's shrunken size. I am sure it's something that you can get used to overtime but it's definitely a major con for otherwise a great product.	1	1	0	1	4
I use this for my small business where I have to go to clients and show them pictures for landscape architecture. It is great because of the touchscreen because I can zoom in on examples and show them what others are doing.

This laptop might be good for younger tech savvy people but for old people like me that just want a laptop to do their work and browse the internet, it is not for them. Everything is completely different about this thing and it is like relearning how to use a computer completely from scratch or worse actually. I tried to download pictures from an sd card and that was a complete nightmare. It was worse than slow. It would have taken atleast week to download 500 pics. This purchase was a complete mistake. I tried to give it a chance and figure it out but after a few days of almost zero progress and endless frustration I returned it.	3	1	0	0	2
Aside from the battery life being short, this is working fine for me. I bought it for school purposes and it's working out well.	3	1	1	8	6
Let me start off by saying this laptop is great. it's very cheap compared to other flipbooks which is nice, and its specs aren't bad considering. It's fast enough to handle normal internet browsing, and of course any office/ school work, its touch screen is great and useful, and it's nice, light, and sleek. the one thing that could be better is the pen. if you're drawing with it you may have difficulties. It regularly will think the pen is not touching the screen for a fraction of a second, so if you hit ctrl+z it will only remove part of what you drew, sometimes this makes gaps in lines aswell. you'll have to press harder than you might be comfortable with and i havent' see na way to increase pen sensitivity just through windows ink or through pen and touch settings. This laptop only has 2 USB ports, a C type and a microUSB type, so you will likely need an adapter. and the microUSB is upsidown for some reason, which is odd. lastly if the screen is free standing, AKA not stood upsidedown like the mail thumbnail or made to look like a tablet, the screen is a bit wobbly, which is fine for touch input, but not for the pen.Overall the cons sound worse than they are, this is a great laptop, it could just use some quality of life improvements aswell as a more functional penPros affordable plenty fast for academic/office work/lightweight drawing software sleek and portable touch screen works great touch keyboard is very responsive all around a good experienceCons pen sensitivity could work better only 2 USB ports, neither of which are the traditional USB-A type you will probably need adapters screen is a little wobbly when using pen in 2 of 4 (or more?) possible positions	2	9	0	2	2

This seemed to be the ideal laptop for me having had a chromebook for 5 years already. in fact, I was so keen I had it shipped from Us to UK (where it is not available). It has lived up to my expectations.Pros: excellent screen streets ahead of the majority of similar chromebooks. excellent track pad rapid boot time touch screen laptop, tablet and other modesCons: not sure it is as robust as older models. I would not recommend it for a student bag for example screen sensitive to movement and I have had to reset it a couple of times to prevent screen flickering uncontrollablyAs a mature light user (internet, emails etc) it suits me perfectly. Best laptop I have ever had but think carefully about its use and how much a chromebook meets your needs before buying.This is the first time I have ever felt the urge to write a review such as this!	1	1	0	1	4
Bought for my daughter to play games on. The windows 10 update took all of the memory on the computer. Had to buy an external hard drive and now works okay. Very slow, but gets the job done. I won't buy for this purpose but it would be great for web surfing as long as you don't need to save or download anything.	2	1	0	1	7

This is a pretty solid laptop. I purchased it about a week ago and it has performed above/beyond my expectations. I switched to this laptop from a Toshiba Satellite, which had such a low processing power that it took an hour for chrome to open. This has an i7 processor which keeps its speeds crisp and quick. To make things easy, I will outline the pros:1. Fast, good processing2. Back-lit Keyboard3. Lightweight, Portable4. Excellent USB Port Access (3 of them)5. Crisp, Vibrant Screen Resolution6. Reasonable Battery Life for a laptop of this size, price rangeThere are a few cons though, but they aren't significant enough for me to lower my rating.1. No CD drive - but this is something I understand since most laptops are made without them nowadays.2. I noticed that removing/inserting anything USB-related is a bit cumbersome. The ports seem a bit too tight for accomadation3. Poor Webcam: the built-in webcam is grainy and is low quality.Thus far, everything else seems pretty good. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. We'll see how well this laptop works over the next few months to years. I will edit this review accordingly.	3	7	2	8	4
Great little computer for writing papers, browsing the web, and watching videos. Very convenient for college students and travelers because the size and weight.

I've only had it for about 3 weeks. Here are some things I love: The price can't beat it, it didn't even seem Refurbished. The chrome OS does all I need to do, the FAST on/off awesome compared to my windows desktop. unit is very sturdy I don't know what other posters were saying about cheap feeling, The speakers are very good for a laptop let alone at this price. .Here are the things I don't like but none are deal breaker as I was not expecting a 499.00 laptop comparison: The screen is not the best but better then I thought but again not spending 500$. The keyboard a learning curve but after awhile no prob, a bit slow sometimes works fine in youtube, Netflix , periscope forget it, works but just not enough power under the hood. Over all it was/is a great choice for me.	3	1	0	0	2

The laptop has great color and viewing angles for this price imo. I have a Dell U2410 (true IPS monitor), calibrated with a spyder 3 pro. With that said I am saying the laptop has a good screen for the money. The colors are fine, the RGB is fine, its all great for the price of the laptop imo. The keyboard is not a mechanical mx cherry switched keyboard, but its a not bad, I don't have any complaints personally with it.Ran a heaven benchmark on Extreme Preset and got a score of 1728, nothing overclocked. Played CS:GO, and Far Cry Primal, everything ran and played great.	3	7	2	8	0

"Hey everyone....this laptop rocks....it is seriously awesome! I don't understand what other users are moaning about. I've read through other comments before buying and some were complaining about it being noisy, or too hot....I've experienced nothing like it. After playing fornite for 3 hours straight the laptop is barely even warm.....far from hot....the fan is on but it is very quiet....I,ve set the game setting to ""epic"" quality and still getting easy 60 frames per second. The HD is definitely NVME....super fast...the laptop boots in 5 seconds....I am vey happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!"	3	6	3	3	0

I just got this today, but I pretty much tell right out of the box that this is going to do exactly what I need it to accomplish. First of all, I'm a freelance writer and photographer, so I will be heavily using Microsoft Office, GIMP, Grammarly, and Spotify. Here are my first impressions (I'll update this review as needed).Pros:I was able to load everything very quickly. It seems like the AMD9 processor is going to do the job well.I've had no problem multitasking thanks to the SSD and 8GB RAMIt's ultra lightweight, which is good because I already have a camera body and a few lenses in my backpack.The 14-inch 1080p screen is way better than the standard def 15.6-inch screen on my old laptop.The built-in SD drive saves me a USB port.Cons:There's no separate keypad on the keyboard, but that is to be expected on a very small laptop.Cortana is obnoxious during startupI had to get rid of a ton of preloaded stuff I didn't want.The video memory is shared (won't matter to me, but I wanted to mention this for gamers or video editors)Let's be honest, it can't match up to the desktop I built for myself specifically to run my business. That having been said, it's a simple and cost-effective way to keep running my business as I travel the world (which is the whole point of my business). I recommend this laptop for freelance writers and photographers, but the shared video RAM is a no-no for video editing or heavy gaming.	2	2	3	3	6
It is a great laptop and for the money its simply awesome. I bought it for school work and some occasional gaming (I know it's more of a gaming laptop but I prefer more graphics than no graphics ;) ). I personally am not a huge gamer, so I allowed my brother to check for fps and stuff. He was getting 60-65 fps on Rainbow Six Siege on medium setting all around and about 30 fps on extremely high settings. I have been using the laptop for a couple of hours now and it feels great and runs smooth. I will update my ratings if something goes wrong (hoping it won't).There is however one big flaw: The track pad feels just awful. Thankfully I had ordered a mouse beforehand so its not a issue for me.Edit: after an entire semester of coding classes, I am extremely happy with the performance. For gaming part, it gets hot after about half an hour of heavy gaming but works fine with lower end gaming and school work.	3	6	3	3	0

I`m just using this laptop for the last 2 days and already en-counting few issues like , fan is very noisy when starts at max power.The back of the laptop become extremely hot when you trying to do multiple tasks , even hotter when the charger is plugged.When i try to access C:/ drive it froze for 20 sec and after that allow me to explore the drive. Kind of disappointed about this laptop which have great configuration for this amount of money cost, i`m still thinking to return or not , if problems persist definitely i will return it.	2	6	5	4	3

"I'm in love with this little guy. It's really not gold, its a champagne color, which I really like (I hate gold colored anything so this made my day). I am giving this 4 stars because it had to do the Windows 10 update, and for some reason it took hours (most of the day). I'm not sure if I did something on my end for it to take so long, or if this is just how long it takes? It's super light, which I will love for when I am in school. I think the keyboard is nice, I know others have commented that its too small or it took them awhile to adapt.. I use a MacBook for work, and I really had no problem. I will likely update down the road once I actually start using it.***Update 12Sep2017***Still works well, but seems to have slowed down quite a bit. I downloaded a couple of Chrome extensions like someone had mentioned on here and it did speed it up a little. I wouldn't say that I am still in ""love"" with this computer, I am in ""like"" with it. I am currently taking EMT classes as well as a math class (both are for college) and it keeps up. It just gets a little frustrating at times."	2	0	0	1	5
Fast, keyboard feels wonderful, as a basic gaming machine it does what I need at a price I can tack. I use it mainly to run multiple photo editting software, photoshop, ACDsee, some canon software and i like to run all at the same time. The processing power and graphic card is making that a breeze. I specialize in making pano's and merged photos for proper exposure and wanted a laptop that could do it without getting bogged down. This has it. Really fast, i can put together 15 raw photos (30mb size each) and while it's processing the photos still be processing batches of basic edits on my other software while I'm surfing the web and do it all with no glitches and it's fast. The flat, non glossy screen is doing a great job and showing me the correct colors also. Used the laptop to edit one set and then transferred my drive to my main calibrated monitor and was very pleased how accurate the match was. Excellent for a laptop monitor. I'll be satisfied to use the screen for such in a pinch to do quick edits and not worry I've made something nuclear or drab.	3	7	2	8	0
One of the reasons I bought this computer was that it said it had good wifi connectivity - total rubbish, it dumps me from my wifi connection many times a day and I am totally annoyed and I think it doesn't deserve any stars. My friend said Lenovo was a good company - more rubbish - I did a search for information on wifi issues and Lenovo and there are lots of pages about how this has been their issue for years - yes they give you some things to try to see if they help, but why can't they fix the problem before they ship the computers to retailers - WHY is it still a problem years later that must be fixed by the buyer!!!! Not good enough. I even bought a realtec wifi extender and had to send it back because the computer wouldn't install it and gave me a message that it is not supported by this computer. The computer I am typing this on has an extender, it is 10 years old and as I watch the signal bars on the new computer fluctuate, they don't move at all on this computer. My 6 year old 11 inch HP doesn't have a signal problem. I wasted my money buying this.	3	1	2	8	6

As a dedicated gaming laptop it's pretty decent, but has trouble on higher settings with more taxing games.As a laptop for any other use, it's not good.The battery life irks me the most about this, and I kick myself for jumping the gun on buying this without actually reading reviews. I can't get 4 hours out of a full charge with light tasks like web browsing or typing papers for class, and gaming kills the battery in a ridiculously short amount of time.The display also looks washed out and I cannot find any way to adjust the color or saturation.The build construction feels cheap, though not overly flimsy. Mold lines left on both halves give a sharp edge that needs taken off with an emery board or sandpaper.I enjoy the appearance of the keyboard but it's far overhyped for what it is, a laptop membrane keyboard.In the end it's a $900 laptop that has some decent hardware but fails in almost every other category.	3	7	2	8	0
Coming from a $2000 gaming desktop and a MacBook pro, I didn't know what to expect from a chromebook other than what I have read online. I was looking for a replacement for my MacBook, but I didn't want or need to spend so much money on a laptop that I would mainly be doing web browsing on (I can use my desktop for anything that requires real muscle). All I have to say is that this is definitely 'The Little Laptop That Could'. I usually have pretty high expectations for my devices being in the IT field, but wow has this thing surpassed my expectations. It is quick and snappy and handles most tasks without even breaking a sweat. For web browsing, this is all the laptop you need. I am heavily invested in google services (google drive, gmail, google photos, google play music, etc.) so this works perfectly, but I would say that if you are not a big google user, especially if you don't use google drive or gmail, a chromebook might not be the best laptop for you. What makes this laptop even better though is the ability to use android apps, so for some light photoshop or lightroom work, I can use the android app which works flawlessly. The display on this thing is second to none, and the keyboard, while small, feels just like my macbook. The two biggest gripes that people have (the small keyboard and the lack of keyboard back lighting), are over exaggerated and I have never had a problem with them.Pros:- amazing screen- ChromeOS is a pleasure to work with- keyboard & trackpad are excellent- build quality is better than $1000+ windows/mac laptops- battery life is awesome- integration with google services is seamless- very easy to use for both novices and professionals- touch screen and stylus are a good bonusCons:- OP1 chipset can stutter sometimes, if you'll be doing HEAVY work on Chrome you might want to go with a chromebook with an m3 processor or betterOverall: This is the best money I have spent on a tech product in a long time. If I find continued success with ChromeOS I might permanently migrate to it	1	1	0	1	4

big disappointment-randomly restarted every day multiple times a day-without warning, closing me out of everything I was working on. I tried changing power and updates settings with no change in behavior. Further internet research revealed this random restarting is a known issue which requires technical intervention and may be linked to a corrupt OS. Fan was very noisy. This laptop was defective in multiple ways from the moment of power on.	3	1	1	8	6

Within a day of receiving the product, the display started freezing constantly, especially when playing a video or using any browser. Basically, it halts for anywhere from 5 to 40 seconds and seems to happen more frequently when you move from one application to another, or even between tabs on a browser. A few months in, this has not resolved at all and has gotten worse. The computer occasionally functions even more poorly than my 6 year old raggedy laptop that I was switching off of - seriously. Luckily I haven't experienced any forced shutdowns, BUT, there have been about 3-5 times when the laptop completely freezes for minutes, forcing ME to shut it down... Extremely disappointing and disgusting for what should be a decently powerful comp.Video games function well, however; if you plan to use this laptop PURELY for gaming, then it may be worth the few hundred you might save over buying a newer, more reliable version.Otherwise, go for the most updated product. This is my only experience with their gaming laptops, but Dell's general purpose products have been above average experiences for me. In this space, it seems like Dell might suck for gaming.	3	8	3	8	0

The power cord came apart on this computer, finally to the point that it will no longer charge the battery. It is not covered by Dell warranty even though the computer is less than a year old. In short, the warranty on this computer is absolutely worthless. Apparently, you have to buy a separate policy to cover the adapter, which is good for Dell, since the adapter, made in China, is of very pull quality if it loosens apart after a month to expose wires. It is probably also dangerous. If you don't care about worthless warranties, go ahead and buy this computer, but not that Dell does not stand behind its products. Then when I was told I would buy the adapter from Amazon and not give Dell any more of my money, I have been subjected to constant harassment from Dell people to explain to me how unreasonable I am to have expected that the warranty included the adapter.	3	8	3	8	0

This laptop really performs well for the price and is a better option for me vs. Chromebooks in a similar price range as it also of course runs full windows apps. I've read some negative reviews concerning the screen but I'm guess they must be referring to the HD version (1366x768) and not this Full HD version (1920x1080 ie. 1080p). The screen looks very decent and I'm very happy with performance of the m3 proccessor. It's also a great looking machine, feels very well made. In my opinion, the look and feel reminds me of the new Macbook Pros, at a fraction of the cost.The only 2 gripes I have are that the keyboard isn't backlit, and that I can't charge the laptop via USB-C, like with the Asus Chromebook C302CA, for example, but I still prefer the bigger screen (14 vs. 12.5 inches) and just purchased an extra power adapter so that I can leave one at home and one at work.Edit: I forgot to mention that in flip/tent or tablet mode, you can of course type right on the touch-screen in the dark, regardless of the non-backlit keyboard, and it also includes a stylus if you want to avoid fingerprints on the screen!	2	9	0	2	4

Other than that it's working good for the price it's a nice addition to my electronics.	3	1	0	0	2
I bought this laptop as my husband's Christmas present. The computer was delivered as promised. Then two days later the Microsoft suite for Home was delivered. When my husband turned on the laptop to begin to load it the Microsoft Suite I had purchase, the laptop locked with a message from Microsoft that the computer had a virus in it and the Microsoft Key was not to be used in this computer. Now, my husband does not have his new laptop for Christmas because we are unable to open it, download a thing, or work with it. Microsoft now wants $400 <> from us to clear the computer. This computer came with this defect and we were not able to even do a thing to it. I also paid with my Discover card the bill which I had over $176.00 in bonus for using my card and if I returned the computer to you this money will disappear! PLEASE TELL ME WHAT AND HOW CAN I FIX THIS PROBLEM. I am a good Amazon Prime customer and have been for many years now.	4	6	1	8	3
I am in the process of returning my purchase due to constant irritating running noise, not sure if it's the hard drive or the cooling fan, but it's extremely annoying, especially if you like to work in a very quiet environment.

"I purchased this laptop for my daughter because of the size and how it was advertised. She needed a smaller laptop to carry around on campus. It's lightweight and serves the purpose for her needs. It was clean, easy to get started and easy to navigate. Having Windows 10 and Office 2016 already installed was a big plus. My only issue with this laptop is that space seems to be limited on the hard drive. A lot of the space appears to be used by the OS. With every Windows 10 update, more space is consumed. The ""running out of space"" error messages constantly appear. I would think that a 32 gig hard drive is more than enough space. Other than that, it's fast, has good connectivity, good screen resolution and is easy to carry."	0	0	0	1	2

So far so good. I've had several Acer desk tops and have been very pleased with them.(My only misstep was the Acer Aspire 'All-in-One'. Nice computer but very limited to add-on resources.)This laptop is pretty new and have not used it a whole lot at this point.I added a $90.00 Crucial 8 GB memory (Now at 16 w. 32 capacity) - easy install and it works fine. I'm not putting a heavy load on the system or gaming - so it suits my needs as expected.I have a Acer desktop that is my primary computer. (the laptop is basically a 'fail safe') - but, with the added mobility and comparatively small footprint.Looks nice - keyboard feels solid. A little clumsy opening the cover - maybe because it is so new. (A bit stiff.) But that's not a big issue.Full HD images seem a little washed out - until you get the screen in just the right position.	3	1	0	0	2

"Got super excited about buying the new Surface laptop and the excitement pretty much ended as soon as I took it out if the box. I won't talk about the lack of USB-C ports, or the longevity of the Alacantara surface material because Tech. websites cover that in detail. I will give you my personal everyday user experience:So opening the laptop is not easy, by easy I mean i should not be struggling to open the screen when I supposedly bought the laptop with the ebst design in the market. There is no hinge, or a little gap for you to slide your thumb in to open the damn thing.The laptop moves around a lot when placed on even slightly polished surfaces. I was at a local coffee shop and it kept moving as I was typing.I could not even connect to the WiFi at the coffee shop. I clicked on the network and it kept trying to connect me for the next 5min. Finally, after looking up an article about this problem with Surface laptop on my Iphone, I had to RESET my Wifi settings on my new laptop for it to work. It's 2017, and this is not acceptable for a machine this expensive or any tech. product no matter the cost.The screen colors are not something I am familiar with. I haven't looked too much in to that but the display has a very unfamiliar shade of white that I am not used to.The laptop is not Up-gradable, meaning 2-3 years in to the future when you decide to upgrade the RAM or storage, you can't. That's a big setback because laptops slow down with time and not being able to upgrade it will cost you well A NEW LAPTOP.So it's been about 2 days since I've had this and the day I started using it, in about 3 hours I had already ordered a Refurbished Macbook Pro, 13"" Oct 2016 release date(Same Price). Now, I am just waiting for that lovely piece of machinery to show up at the Apple store so I can return this sad attempt at recreating the Macbook by my neighbors in Seattle."	2	8	2	3	3

WHAT A FANTASTIC LAPTOP ! All software loaded without any issues. It is blazing fast, and the back-lit keyboard is great.There are no issues at all. This was my initial assessment.After using this laptop for 3 weeks, I can say without a doubt that it is THE BEST laptop I have ever owned. It is super-fast. It boots quickly, and the programs load fast. The display is beautiful.	4	7	3	8	0

Flimsy charger. Broken in few weeks. ASUS does not sell replacement. They suggest that I should buy generic one. Device is still under warranty. Debating whether to go through trouble of getting a new one (or a replacement) and reinstalling everything or just buy a charger. Some consolation- ASUS customer service says generic charger wont void warranty on device.For anyone interested in buying, the status is same for battery! No replacement part!Unfortunate, because it is a good laptop. Poor after-sale support kills brands......	3	6	2	8	3

I dont like it that much adnd also come with a sound problem, it make poor contact with the speaker when you move the screen and i can return because i send it to a friend outside the country, really disapointed with this product.

After reading mixed reviews, I decided to wait a few months before posting a review. I use this laptop almost every single day. It has been great. There haven't been any problems. I have always had Dell PCs. Rarely have I had any problems with them. Dell is usually pretty good at helping customers resolve any PC issues.The bottom line is that I am very happy with this laptop.	3	4	1	8	3
Other than backlit keyboard, every other specs are very satisfactory with this price.. Screen is very crisp and CPU speed is very fast. Furthermore, the thickness of PC is also very ergonomic for typing. I am using 3 asus laptop. Overall, Asus laptop give excellent experiences..^^	3	7	3	8	3

I bought two of these chromebooks for Christmas present our two teen kids. Both products arrived dirty with many stains on the cover and highly scratched keyboard surface. I spent hours trying unsuccessfully to clean both products. The advertising listing and picture suggested it was silver metal surface but it was a white plastic coating that has many reports of stains. The notebook function and screen are fine so far but we had to spend $20 each on a new cover. Requested help from seller but only obtained an automatic response. After days of no response to our questions and concerns we were forced to get the covers.	2	1	0	0	4
"The performance of this laptop is great, but the level of pressure for the ""e"" key is much greater than the forc required to press other keys, which makes it annoying when I'm typing because I'll often press the ""e"" key too lightly for it to register when that amount of force would be fine on any other key (this is a mechanical issue). This fairly little problem causes me to have to retype a lot of words, and it is the only problem I have with it, although I bet it's just a problem with my specific laptop. If this didn't occur I'd give it 5 stars. I might return it to get the same model."	2	5	2	3	4

"I think the star rating for this laptop is skewed a bit because the product page is for 3 different models.I bought the ""rose gold"" 4GB 11.6"" model, and so far I've been really pleased.The 4GB of RAM is crucial to getting the most from the processor. No surprise that a majority of the one star reviews on here are for the 2GB model.All hardware works perfectly, all inputs feel very snug and secure. The only port I haven't tried is the mini HDMI.The full size keyboard is a nice touch. The trackpad material is satisfyingly smooth and responsive. Gestures work great. It can lag a tiny bit if the computer gets bogged down but that happens rarely.No flapping or give on the hinge for the screen, and the surface of the plastic doesn't show fingerprints. The build quality and design of this machine is way beyond the price point.The speakers are very meh. They sound nice and clear but the bass response is absent.Now for the screen: I really want to emphasize that the factory settings for the display don't do it justice. Take the time to calibrate it and fine tune the HD graphics settings and you will be able to get a lot more contrast and vibrancy from the screen. Photos and videos looked much better after some adjustment.This laptop is extremely portable, and though it might not be Macbook Air level thin, it is actually lighter. But the light weight does not keep this from feeling like a quality computer. I did a ton of research on similar laptops with more reviews before I went for this one. I'll update this review if I experience problems in the future, but for $200 this was an excellent purchase."	2	0	0	1	5

For $199? Are you kidding? This thing is great. I have an iPad, but needed something non-Mac to take with and run Word and actually for one client, Word Perfect. This little guy does the trick. Keep in mind, I don't have excessive expectations of it, just a little word processing is all I do with it, a little web surfing and sometimes I put a disc in my external drive and watch that, but otherwise what more could you ask for for that price. I mean honestly!	2	0	0	1	5
After a year of use, this chromebook has stood up to the test of time. Purchased as a replacement for a laptop for netflix, it has evolved into an app machine I use for my numerous apps I use on my phone. Most are compatibile. I use it likely 3-4 hours a day as a replacement for my phone when at home and replacement for my laptop.	1	1	0	1	4
"Buyer beware! This was supposed to be ""like new."" While the screen was in great shape, but one of the USB ports was severely damaged and unusable and the speaker cover underneath was also damaged.

"I like the laptop itself (although I never did get around to checking out the speakers, because of all the problems I had trying to set up the OS the way I wanted (can't be done), getting it to run the software I want to use & accept the file associations I wanted to set). Then there is the fact that Windows 10 is loaded with bloatware you can't uninstall or even disable, all kinds of subscription ""services"" that just cost you money--including the formerly free games like freecell & solitaire, it collects all kinds of information whether you want it to or not, which you can limit somewhat but not eliminate, & generally just insists on running your computer however it wants to regardless of anything you might want or need."	2	5	2	3	4

I've been a Lenovo fan for years because their more expensive laptops come with beautiful matte or anti-glare screens. This laptop however is not just glossy. It is more of a mirror than a laptop. I can see my reflection in the screen when it is at full brightness!It may be OK if you only work in a dim room with no windows and no bright lights.	3	5	2	3	3

How can Amazon advertise such poor quality item as Prime? Folks, take a look at all the reviews. The Chromebook case is badly worn and has a dirty appearance but unfortunately you can't wash off the dirt as its rubbed in so deeply. Mine was also missing rubber feet.

I'm really impressed with this laptop, I got just as what was describe in the description.The built quality is so amazing, love the feel of the keyboard, wonderful display quality and resolution and most of all it runs smooth.

Purchased the laptop for my children and myself to complete reports, homework, surfing the web, pretty much clerical work.

First of, the laptop I received had a battery defect so I requested for a replacement the very next day I got it. I received the replacement after 2 days and I fell in love with the features especially with the price. I only use it for the basic stuff and it isn't that fast but I'm fine with it. But after 2 weeks of use, one of the hinges became misaligned rendering it unable to be closed without breaking it. I wasn't being careless or anything, I was just closing it like I usually do and I just heard a something crack all of a sudden. I am very disappointed with the quality of this one. It's hinges are supposed to be one of the strongest parts since it transforms into a tablet. I just hope I'll be able to return this and I will definitely get a more pricey one. Just waiting for asus to respond to my email.	2	9	0	2	2

For what my mother uses this for, it is perfect for her. A million times better than that cheap crappy trash HP she used to have (that she now no longer touches). Although I am disappointed in one thing, the right touchpad key tends to stay down either when neither button is clicked for a while or the right button is clicked multiples times consecutively. It's fine once you click the left mouse button once but it can be annoying. Every light indicator is on the front side of the laptop keyboard in a row, where your left wrist is likely to cover it when typing.Edit: It appears the touchpad thing is not uncommon among laptops with that particular type of seamless, full touch touchpad. Mine does it to. Bumped this laptop up to 5 stars. Now I know for the next laptop I get that the physical touch buttons are better as they have never given me problems before. I hope they don't get phased out of gaming laptops anytime soon. This particular laptop is holding up pretty well, I would definitely say it is great for students with every day school work, studying, etc. If you use the touch pad with your right hand, be prepared to reach over a bit farther than usual, I personally don't like that the touchpad is so far to the left but it's nothing much to complain about. Unless you like to play games using WASD+Touch, in which case this is a very irritating setup. I can say nothing about the fingerprint scanner as my mother doesn't use it. Overall I'm so glad I decided to get this laptop for my mom, I almost gave her a touchscreen one from another manufacturer that actually got recalled for defects just a few months later!	3	6	2	8	3
I got a lemon.First off, you'll need to install an m.2 ssd otherwise this thing will take forever to boot up and install Steam Games, this thing will be at 100% disk usage without it.I had so many issues, after all the drivers were installed and updated, the speakers made a popping sound randomly. And the WORST issue was that the GTX 1050 graphics card was NOT WORKING, it was updated, and shown in device manager, yet no games used it. Yes, I tried so many solutions from the internet, switching the Nvidia Panel settings, reinstalling windows, reinstalling drivers, nothing worked. I explained this to ASUS, who wanted me to send it in, but that will take a month, which is forever, so I'll just return and hopefully not get another LEMON.	3	6	3	8	0

"I've had this laptop for a month and aside from one bothersome issue--I'm happy (not ecstatic) with the purchase. First the good stuff--I'm a novelist so the keyboard is extremely important to me. The size of the keys, the distance between them, and the sound, need to be spot-on. I like the keyboard on this Dell in every way (except the touchpad is a bit flaky and launches my cursor into the document). The speed is very good for what I do (90% word processing with some browsing and occasional streamed movie). The color and clarity of the screen is also very good and the speakers are surprisingly good. No problems there. The weight is not what I would call ""light"" but it is an improvement from my old Dell laptop from 8 years ago. And the battery--very good, again relative to what I do.My problem is with the fan. It turns on after about 30 minutes of word processing--and won't go off. And it is loud compared to some laptops I have used with SSDs that are so quiet for so long you wonder if they are even on. Not this machine. That is a problem for me since the distraction is, well, distracting. I thought with the quadcore and 16GB of RAM is would stay relatively cool and quiet. Nope. It is whizzing now after twenty minutes of use and shows no sign of letting up. If not for the fan, I would gladly give this otherwise fine performer a solid five stars. I was hoping for a quiet machine. This one is a talker!"	2	6	3	3	3
This computer was FULL of bloatware. EBAY, Netflix, Priceline and other obnoxious applications. After going through and deleting all the crap, I am happy with this laptop. It is still running a bit slower than I imagine it should, but I'm going to have my brother-in-law check my apps again and help me with it.	3	7	3	8	6

Slow, and I mean SLOW out of the box. It took forever just to set up the computer, and when I did the computer acted like it was 5 years old with a full hard drive. It took forever to open up any program, froze when I tried to search for a program, took minutes to shut down and restart, etc. After a google search this is apparently common for this specific Lenovo computer. I was about ready to return it, but I have a basic reset a try. That didn't work (still slow clunky), so in one final attempt I did a full reset and with a deep erase of all data on the computer, and that finally worked! It seems to be acting fine for the most part now.This computer really deserves one stall as there is no reason it should have worked that way out of the box and passed any sort of QC, but its saving grace is that with a lot of work to get it set up correctly it is actually a decent computer with great specs. Thinking that with a SSD someday it will actually be pretty snappy.	3	2	1	8	7

Look, there's a lot of value here, don't get me wrong. For a little bit more than the cost of the operating system (OS), you get a whole computer. But there one feature about this laptop that makes me dread having to work on it.THE TRACKPAD ON THIS IS UNHOLY AWFUL GARBAGE. It is the most piercing singular source of frustration I have ever experienced with any electronics. It's garbage. It's accuracy is poor, it's registration is poor, it's multi-finger input is clumsy and imprecise, and every once in a while it just stops working entirely.Good buy if you want to also carry around a mouse.	2	0	0	1	5

"I just bought the Surface laptop in Cobalt, I wanted the Burgundy but it was out of stock. I am a 60 year old professional who is not technologically sophisticated. I have a 17"" HP laptop at home that I love, but I desperately needed something light and easy to use. I travel quite a bit and I wanted to bring my laptop to work to take notes. My 17"" HP was too heavy. I tried out the Surface Pro and it is adorable but screen is too small. The HP two in ones were great and I actually bought one but turned out to be too heavy for regular back and forth to office so I returned it for this laptop. This laptop is just right, very light but I can work with the screen size just fine. I absolutely love the touch screen, and the material the keyboard is made from. It's really comfortable. The touchpad with cursor is very easy to use, though I still prefer a mouse. I'll get the pen soon.The Windows 10S that it comes with is annoying but the upgrade to regular Windows wasn't too difficult. The number of USB ports is small for all the things I like to attach, but no worries, I simply bought a USB attachment in Best Buy that has 4 ports in it for my mouse, printer, and flashdrives. I got a year subscription for Word, Excel, and Power Point but this suite does not come with Outlook which is separate. Best Buy transferred all my documents easily, but transferring everything I had saved in Outlook was quite difficult and time consuming, and it wasn't perfect but it is up and running now. I am still practicing using the new Outlook. All in all, I just love the size and weight of this laptop!."	2	7	2	3	3

I give this 5 stars.First, it's only very inexpensive computer. But what you get in screen size and keyboard is very good for the money. I bought this for my church to do QuickBooks Online software. It looks like this was a wise decision since we do not need any onboard storage (computer has some though). I am impressed with the speed and screen brightness. I have watched movies and videos online without problems.I think I may buy one for my family to use. It is solid and does not have any loose or poorly fitting parts, but it is not as solidly built as a MacBook, but what can you expect for 1/5 fo the price. It is well worth the money I spent. If you have a kid or an older parent this should be a great computer for them because no Windows updates or virus software to fight or confuse the user. Be aware it is Google-centric and takes a google account to fully access all features.I have not tried games or anything like that on the computer but I am impressed with the machine compared to my daughter's Chromebook computer (3-4 years old), it's much snappier and the screen is much better in brightness and clarity.	3	1	0	0	2
So far so good.I had a Lenovo Idea laptop for 6 years .It was fanatastic ,never broke down ,but is running slow now.And is so heavy.The Asus is so light 2.6lbs versus 4.7lbs.It boots in seconds,is fast,great picture on screen.If it holds up im going to really like it.Some reviews scared me .Noisy fan ,can't hear the fan at all.So do I have any complaints ? Well yes ,not serious ones .Too few USB's only 2 ,I always had 3 and miss the extra one.The keys are ok ,only ok ,not excited about them.Also I thought the keyboard was backlit,well ttheyr'e not..Despite those negatives ,I think I will really love this computer .I think you will too.I'm glad I waited for the 8th generation ,it's great.1/14/2018 :After using this for a couple of weeks ,I have simmered down a bit.First I wish the screen was a little sharper and being a small screen it gets a little hard to read the lettering.I also notice that the sound while ok ,is not too great.I'm comparing this Zen to a Lenovo ideapad which is 6 or 7 years old,much sharper, better sound ,but almost twice as heavy.I notice it is (kinda) backlit ,again not as well backlit as the Lenovo .I will say the Lenovo cost $200 more than the Zen.What I appreciate most is the 7 second boot time and the long battery life.2/2/2018An update.I got a scare a week ago.I got a black screen ,it wouldn't boot.I kept trying turning of and on for an hour.Eventually it started to work again.I did a restore point.The only problem with buying a computer online is ,it's not easy to return.Prices are better on Amazon but unlike Best Buy you can't drive and return it.Food for thought.	2	5	2	3	4
"I can't find the power cord anywhere on line, so I fear what will happen once I need a new one. Other than that, it works as well as expected of a ""computer"" this size.UPDATE: Over time I started experiencing more and more errors. I only use it for light browsing and viewing pdf files, which I often deleted after viewing. Now the computer freezes and restarts multiple times a day. I have reset the computer to the original manufacture settings and it's still crashing. Please spend more money and get something that will last."	2	0	0	1	5

I have so many different views on this laptop. The 17.2 inch monitor is just, amazing... It's almost as if I'm using playing on a portable desktop. The graphics that come with the laptop are basically what you'd expect from a gaming laptop from a $1,000 laptop, so it's pretty much a win win. The backlit steel series keyboard and cooling is pretty great and convenient. I love it!	4	8	3	8	0

"It's hard to get excited about this machine because it's built to meet very basic expectations at a very low price point. I don't know how it compares to laptops selling at the same price or less but I for one am astounded at how much value there is at the price.The top of the laptop is black textured plastic. It's textured kind of like a fabric weave and looks like it will resist scratches, probably better than metal tops do. Overall it is surprisingly light and thin. It has molded raised feet on the bottom that are about 1/8"" thick. Without those it would be even thinner but they probably help with cooling.I could complain about the limited memory and processor speed but I won't because this thing is faster and has almost as much memory as a laptop I used until 2011 which I paid over $1000 for. Considering how cheap plug-in memory is these days (and getting cheaper) it's easy to spend between $20 and $100 and get additional memory from a 32gb usb up to a 1000gb external usb drive.Even though external memory is cheap, this laptop won't win any races rendering video and probably won't run a lot of games at a satisfactory speed. If all you need to do is poke around on the internet, word processing and basic photo editing type things however it is very adequate. It also comes with Windows 10 for the price of some laptops which run free operating systems. I've been using Windows 10 for over a year now and find it mostly trouble free and intuitive.The keyboard and mousepad are unimpressive but serviceable.While I do think this is a great value, you could easily spend a little more and get a laptop that looks and feels nicer and has more onboard memory."	2	0	0	1	2
I got burned on the original Surface when it came out (I had an RT which was horrible, so I traded for a Pro with Win8). That Surface got slower and slower with its many, many updates, to where the system was so bogged down that it was unusable. On top of that, hardware challenges began to show after a few weeks and by month three I loved it a lot less than on Day One. So I waited a few months before reviewing this laptop to see if it had similar issues.Fortunately, Microsoft seems to have ironed out a lot of the issues. This laptop may not have all the cool-hip factor of a convertible tablet, but its full-sized keyboard and solid casing are eminently practical while its feather weight and ultra-slim profile still keep it in the fashionably-cool category. Mine has and i5 processor and 8GB of RAM and that seems adept at most things I do (it's only a little sluggish with some games like Forza 6 and with Access). Were I chronically trying to do either, I would splurge for the i7/16GB, but the entry set will work for most tasks.The keyboard is responsive. My only gripe is my 30-year history of right-handed Control+Enter is busted by this keyboard's layout, which replaces the right control key with a menu key and no easy way to re-map it. It is backlight, but more a hint of backlit than my VAIO or Alienware, which actually makes it more eye-friendly in the dark. The large track pad is very responsive and reads the full range of touch and swipe options (some of which are turned off my default - weird).The aluminum case is sharp looking, though my dented pretty easily while in my laptop bag with my mouse. The power cord attach is magnetic, with a bar clip that makes aligning it a snap (ba da ch!). I will say the battery default power setting lets it drain pretty quickly, so if you're like me and use yours while flying, you may consider switching to lower-power options (this gets me from about 6 hours of heavy use to 12 - a nice leap, especially considering it's not the fastest charging device).Finally, for what it's worth: I do not like Win10S any more than I liked Win8RT. I know it makes the system lighter, faster, and more Android/iOS-ish, but it also makes it impossible to run my work software, any legacy software, and just in general I reject the idea (been using Microsoft since the DOS 3.0 days, so I guess I'm stuck in the mindset of me telling my computer what it will do, not the other way around). So for my 2 cents, just upgrade to full Windows 10 when you get it. The upgrade is free for the remainder of 2017, and only $50 beginning in 2018 (purchase via the Windows Store).	2	7	2	3	3
"When looking for a personal computer that had the processing power, memory, and capability of a $1000 computer for $500, this laptop was an obvious choice for an amazing deal. It is a ""business"" computer, however, it can be used for any function that you wish, it was just designed with the business person in mind. I am using it for college classes and it works great. There is no nonsense software that comes preloaded, only the expected programs.As the description states, it does come with Windows 10 pre-downloaded. You may get an error message on startup that your Windows version is not activated and receive an error code. DO NOT FREAK OUT. You did not get a pirated version of Windows, all you need to do is update the Windows version in your ""Settings"" and the error will be resolved and your version of Windows will reflect a registered, legitimate copy. The error has to do with IPv6/IPv4 resolution in communication with the Windows server that pushes updates.This computer is reasonably fast and functional, I have many tabs open and processes running and my characters appear as I type them with no lag whatsoever. The setup is VERY simple, you basically have to plug it in, turn it on, update your Windows version, and download Chrome or Firefox if you so choose and you will be set up. The Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) is a trial version, so you may have to purchase the software if you need it later on down the road.The only negative aspect of this computer so far is that on the palm rest and touch pad, your hands leave obvious marks from the touch. A simple wipe down solves this, it is a minor complaint.Overall, this is a GREAT laptop for the money you will pay. For an average user, you may never use all of the memory available, and it will be fast enough for your daily browsing, school, or whatever it is you do on your computer. For the more proficient users, upgrading the hard drive or RAM is fairly simple and easy, all it takes is a couple of screws and you are where you need to be."	3	6	2	8	3
This is SOOO not the computer pictured on Amazon. I specifically purchased this one because it had all the features that i needed, plus a number keypad on the right hand side. This one, as you can see pictured does not. I'm not satisfied with my purchase.	2	0	0	1	2
