Great laptop for the price. It meet or exceeded all my expectations after reading many of the reviews on here and from other research online. My last laptop was an Asus that had held up very well and still performs pretty well, so I wanted to stay with a brand that I've been able to rely on. The fingerprint sensor makes logging in a breeze and it stays up from the scan nearly instantly. Occasionally there is a little lag but nothing to bad. This has everything I need for my usage and I'll probably never touch more than half the memory but it's nice to have such a large amount of storage just in case. I've been using it for about a month and a half and no issues have come up with it.	3	7	3	8	6
Bought this computer (about 3 months ago) because I wanted something mid range that was travel friendly and could handle basic gaming. I'm happy to say that this laptop meets all of those criteria. Super light weight and boots up fast. I can play league of legends for hours without any issue. Some points that may be helpful to some people: My computer crashed after playing games and having a video open in Chrome. From my experience the computer life is no where near what is advertised. It's more like 5-6 hours rather then 10. Also, a bit disappointed that it didn't come with a longer, more sturdy power cord with a ground. Just came with a standard two pronged power adapter. All that said though, I'm very happy with my purchase. Definitely a good buy if you're looking for something travel friendly, and something that can handle standard tasks plus a little more.	3	7	3	8	6
As an experienced Windows 10 user, this laptop was absolutely beyond my expectations after I purchased it. I've had it for almost 3 months and the performance is amazing. It's very fast even on slower internet speeds, and weighs very little with a very sleek design. I can store almost anything with the storage capabilities. I rated this laptop 5 stars because I couldn't imagine anything better. The only thing I would change if I could is the quality of the webcam. It's low pixel and not the best for video chatting. The speakers are okay with adequate bass. I've only had Dell laptops before but I will definitely be purchasing Asus again in the future.	3	7	3	8	6
"A great laptop. The weight is a killer spec. Only 1.6 kilogram which is 1.5 times less then my previous 15"" laptop. The screen is ok (better then my previous laptop but not as good as my desktop). SSD+HDD combo is good if you need both speed and storage. I initially thought that just SSD would be a better option so it would be a little bit lighter and spent less power (but would have less storage). Battery is disappointing a little bit (it is not a long lasting one. I initially thought it would be enough for a day, but it is actually for 3-5 hours of work).I like the keyboard and touchpad. As well as fingerprint which allows to log in quickly.Overall great product."	3	7	3	8	6
This is a great computer, be it a laptop or a vivo book. No matter what you call it it works. I love the metal body and the finish on it. It has all the things I wanted including ,i7, I have used Asus help/chat line several times and they have been great about walking me through any problem I was having.	3	7	3	8	6
This was purchase for my wife. She loves it. She is very impressed with the performance. The slim, light weight package is a plus.	3	7	3	8	6
This product is great, and I would highly recommend it.	3	7	3	8	6
Great Screen Size and not too Heavy, Thinner than most. Amazon Prime Delivery Delayed	3	7	3	8	6
I have had this laptop for a few days now and I love it! It is very fast. The only thing that I wish it had (and I knew this before purchasing) is a numeric keypad, so I have to use the number buttons on the top. The fingerprint scanner is also a very nice feature.	3	7	3	8	6
Lightweight and has solid state drive which makes it start up super fast. I also like that the keyboard design helps keep it clean, My previous laptop accumulated all sorts of stuff between the keys. However it is a bit too sensitive for me and any small touch is interpreted as a movement. Also the battery life does not 6 hours as stated.	3	7	3	8	6
It’s so lightweight! I’ve had it for about two months. Don’t love the mouse/trackpad at all, but that’s easily solved by using a plug in.	3	7	3	8	6
Light, good size screen, fast, and reliable!	3	7	3	8	6
I bought this on impulse, I didn't intend to buy another laptop for at least two or three years.But after seeing my daughter with a computer that had an SSD, I will admit to jealousy.My old computer took about three minutes to start and was much slower than her's was and I guess that stuck in my thoughts.I was idly looking on here for another Asus that had an SSD and couldn't find one for my normal five hundred dollars and under price when I clicked on this and was like a schoolgirl with a crush.The processor, HD screen, SSD, plus another 1TB memory, I added it to my cart and bought it.I had regret for a few days until it came and I opened the box and saw it, I had been intending to return it but, instant puppy-love hit me again.Three people have asked to buy my older computer, but I have refused because I still feel an attachment for the old one.	3	7	3	8	6
Love this! I was hesitant on buying an Asus just because I've always been a Mac girl, but I'm very pleased with this so far.	3	7	3	8	6
Absolutely LOVE this laptop. Very lightweight.	3	7	3	8	6
Turns on quickly. Strong wireless connection. Very portable and light weight. Fast processing. Probably the best computer I've ever purchased.	3	7	3	8	6
Typing responsiveness is fast, log in time fast, overall performance fast. This company has taken laptop use to a whole new level. I use it for school and have no problem paring it via Bluetooth to any other device necessary.	3	7	3	8	6
I bought this for my son, a first year college student, and he is very pleased with the performance with this machine.	3	7	3	8	6
Awesome exactly what I expected best laptop ever....	3	7	3	8	6
Very happy with this computer! I bought it to replace an older ASUS which served me faithfully for eight years. Was time to replace it with another ASUS.	3	7	3	8	6
Love this computer! Great purchase for the money. It's quick and reliable. No complaints!	3	7	3	8	6
The keyboard failed within a month and a half. I tried communicating with Asus but they did not help. Amazon let me return it late but I only got a refund for 80%.	3	7	3	8	6
Love it. Received in good quality and with backlit keyboard. However the excel inside need to be re-installed for the account keeps showing unlicensed. The 15.6 inch screen looks great.	3	7	3	8	6
Great price, great features and a good looking laptop!!!	3	7	3	8	6
This computer DOES NOT WORK WITH ANY HEADSET/MIC. Per Tech Support, if it uses a headphone, it cannot also use a mic. RIDICULOUS! DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WILL EVER WANT TO USE A HEADSET/MIC!	3	7	3	8	6
Don’t get me wrong: this laptop is light years ahead of any computer I have ever owned. It is slim, light, fast, great looking… I really wanted one that had an SSD and hard drive so I could work quickly but store a lot of photographs and at work. But for streaming video it is terrible – the sound is very quiet and very muffled. I don’t want to have to get external speakers or wear headphones every time I want to watch a show. Haven’t decided if I’m going to return it but I’m very disappointed.	3	7	3	8	6
I was the best choice! I am so happy with this purchase	3	7	3	8	6
CPU problem, fan overruns most of the time (even when simple websites in use) over %100, freezing and not responding to mouse pad. Returned for an another unit...	3	7	3	8	6
nice screen. like the touch pad.	3	7	3	8	6
Absolutely wonderful! works well and just what i needed.	3	7	3	8	6

Amazing computer. Does everything I want it to. Speakers are crap and so is webcam	3	7	3	8	6
my laptop is shutting down 2-3 times in week showing errors always different i tried contact product support twice and nobody answered to me and when i contacted ASUS support service they told me what i need to do and on the end they told me that it has internal issue but seller or even product support is not reacting on my emails ...	3	7	3	8	6
Overall, the laptop works well while having an appealing design -- however, there are many different factors that will make you hate this computer. First, the graphics are terrible -- even with Intel integrated graphics, the computer cannot manage to perform tasks that are simple in terms of graphical demand. While the computer can run videos on YouTube, it cannot manage to run Netflix (I have 150mbps, so it is not due to my internet connection). The image usually appears extremely blurry, and there is nothing you can do to resolve this issue. Secondly, the speakers sound average at best, but the major issues are due to the speaker's location, which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight, solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear. Thirdly, the battery life is terrible -- if I'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer, the battery is dead within 1-3 hours. Lastly, if you are into gaming, this computer fails in every category. Obviously, this computer is not designed to handle gaming, but playing games that are very basic, two dimensional, and primitive can barely run. On the plus side, this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs (Word, PowerPoint, email, small projects, video chat).To reiterate, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Lightweight- Attractive Design- Performs Small Application Very Well- Light-Up Keyboard- Easy-To-Type Keyboard- Can Handle Programming- Overall Reliable- Thin DesignCons:- Highly Overpriced- Fails To Run Many Applications- Bad Battery Life- Graphics Are Terrible And Replacing The Graphics Card Will Not Help Much (It Is The Computer Itself)- Cannot Be Used For Entertainment Purposes (Netflix, Gaming)	3	7	3	8	6
fastest PC out there	3	7	3	8	6
love it	3	7	3	8	6
Good build quality,light weight.Easy to carry around anywhere.Sleek design.Not the best audio quality,but is good for people who use it for office work.People using it for media purposes,its not the best option.	3	7	3	8	6
User observations on the ASUS VivoBook S:The Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz processor lets me bring up applications far more quickly than on any computer I have had before.Even though the laptop frame size is what traditionally has house a 14” monitor, the narrow bezel allows it to hold a 15.6” monitor it seems larger.There is no wasted space and it uses almost the entire monitor, making for an impressively large picture.The picture is super crisp with very sharp images.The aesthetics are great. It is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops I’ve had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.My only complaint is that the Delete key is right next to the Power button. This, according to Murphy’s Law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on. For this reason, I give this computer four stars. Aside from that, I loved it.	3	7	3	8	6
I bought this for my son when he started college this fall. He LOVES it. I got it 2 days after I ordered it. The screen is nice and big, it is extremely light weight, and it is just looks nice.	3	7	3	8	6
It's just ok. Battery is not that great and I am having extremely irritating issues with wi-fi. It continuously loses internet connection. The internet issue started about a month ago, a few months after I purchased this. It has trouble just finding a wi-fi to connect to and when it does it loses it. I have restarted in and shut it down, waited a while, and started back up and still internet issues. When you pay over $800 for a laptop you would expect it to work perfectly for at least a year especially since I don't do much on it	3	7	3	8	6
Love it!	3	7	3	8	6
It's a great device however I received it with a dent on the lid. Very disappointing.	3	7	3	8	6
Awesome. Only thing I don’t like it that it has no numerical keyboard . You have to use upper keyboard numbers. But otherwise awesome! I have always had good result with ASUS. A+	3	7	3	8	6
I wish it had a number keypad on the right hand side.	3	7	3	8	6
Great full-featured Windows 10 laptop. it has pretty much any port you would want, including USB Type-C for future applications. I wish that it charged like my Asus Chromebook: with USB Type-C; but I would guess it's because it uses more power than the connection can supply. Right out of the box I had an application for it: I installed Kodi with my Plex Add-on, then connected it to my TV Via HDMI and I was running home movies via my Plex server in less than 20 minutes.Like with any OEM laptop, there is some bloatware to it. I uninstalled most of it. The year subscription to McAfee is a joke: go with Comodo if you want a quality security application.	3	7	3	8	6
Graphics are not good. Battery life? 8hrs? Lol non- existent, more like 8 minutes. Cannot even connect to Wi-Fi properly. My old hp amda8 series... with a broken screen lol is working better. I've only had the laptop a few hours and I completely regret the purchase. The only good thing is the exterior looks bomb.	3	7	3	8	6
This laptop has many excellent features. It is super light so you won’t get shoulder strain if you want to carry it around all day in a laptop bag. The laptop just looks nice, from the backlit keyboard to the clear bright screen. It starts up quickly. The specs are impressive and It has performed great so far with internet use, photo editing, word processing, and some Steam gaming. I don’t think this would be the best system for a hardcore gaming machine, but it’s great for games that are not extremely system demanding. It has a good size hard drive which is a definite plus. Overall, an nice machine that should perform well for someone needing to do typical home computer work and light gaming.	3	7	3	8	6
I would try to be as neutral as I can because even after getting the defective device, I would do a full analysis. When I received the laptop, the first impression was amazing but I was only able to use it foe about 10minutes. After configuring the windows, when I put it on charging and came back after an hour, there was no power indication and when I tried to turn it on, nothing happened. It was just like a dead machine.I would say when I turned it on in first place, the display was eye-catching but the brightness is only 250 nits at maximum. A lot of people complained about the flex in keyboard, to be honest, it was not a big deal. Likewise, the backlit on keyboard was more than satisfactory.Verdict: Its a mid-level laptop from Asus. I would recommend everyone to save some more bucks and go for some high end device e.g. Xps 13 or 15, Hp Spectre, Lenovo X1 Carbon.	3	7	3	8	6
DOWNGRADED to 2 stars because of the supplied Operating System. Don't buy unless you're willing to format. The Win 10-Home that comes with it is USELESS. I'm losing many hours of work because the unmanageable updates are constantly breaking my programs. The audio pops all the time and the video on my HDMI began to spaz out after one of these unrequested updates.UPDATE: upgraded to Win 10 per ASUS support suggestion and it has solved NOTHING !! It's fast but all the quirks will drive you crazy. Go find a Toshiba or Lenovo.UPDATE: ASUS support completely clueless. Tells me to format. They have no real 2nd tier knowledge to solve problems. They just e-mail people telling them to format.	3	7	3	8	6
Se demoró en llegar la ASUS	3	7	3	8	6
I failed to see that this thing doesn't have an optical drive....	3	7	3	8	6
I paid over $1,500 for this Asus. Had it 15 months. It stopped working. I took it back to Best Buy to get it repaired. I was told it would cost more to have it repaired than to purchase a new one. To bad I paid cash.No recourse. Purchase an Asus at your own risk.	3	7	3	8	6
"Bought this laptop to run Manjaro KDE (Linux) and act as my primary ""everyday use"" computer at home. Ill break the review down into 2 parts. Ill start first with the hardware which should be helpful to anyone reading this and then the second part will specifically be about using Linux on it. Model is Dell i5379-5893GRY-PUS (Dell Inspiron 13"" 2-in-1 touchscreen)Hardware:The build quality is nice. Despite being a plastic shell (instead of metal like the Inspiron 7000) it feels of good quality to the point of questioning if it is plastic. The finish is nice and doesn't appear to attract finger prints as much as glossier finishes. Its a good balance of enough weight to not feel cheap but not too much that its ""heavy"" for its size.Specs:* Intel i5-8250U (8th gen i5 with 4c/8t @ 15watt TDP)* Intel UHD Graphics 620 (integrated graphics, no dedicated GPU)* 8GB DDR4 2400mhz RAM (I think 1x8GB, will have to verify)* 256GB SATA SSD (Samsung PM871 from what I can tell, seems to be 2.5"" 7mm not m.2)* 13"" 1920x1080 IPS touchscreen (glossy, but not terrible)* Webcam supports Windows HelloPorts:2x USB 3.1 type-A1x USB 2.0 type-A1x HDMI (listed as 1.4)1x SD card reader1x Headphone/mic combo jackThe monitor has, in my opinion, pretty large bezels. At first I was disappointed by this but considering its ability to take a tablet form, this likely was done to give something to hold onto in tablet mode without touching the screen by accident. Otherwise its sharp and bright with decent viewing angles.The rear of the base has a short, somewhat wide vent to exhaust hot air out and does have an active fan however at its loudest it was negligible. I would have to focus on trying to hear it to notice. The upside is it should allow longer boost times on the CPU before throttling sets in.I found it a bit strange at first that the power and volume rocker are on the right side towards the front of the machine, but have since gotten used to it and figure it is also likely purposeful due to being able to use it like a tablet.The hinge between the base and monitor is sturdy and feels like it should last if treated well. I dont notice any wobbling while typing on a hard flat surface. The keyboard is ok but not great. I like the look of it and the backlighting can be plenty bright but the feel leaves a bit to be desired. The key presses seem to allow for pressure un-evenly on a key allowing one side to press further than the others which gives the sense that its not that sturdy. I would expect for the press to evenly push the key down but on this keyboard its a bit ""mushy"". For what its worth it appears to be the exact same keyboard as the Inspiron 13"" 7000 series. On the flip side, the touch pad is pretty nice and I typically hate touchpads. This one is pretty large and the buttons (bottom right and left of the touchpad itself) are clicky.It doesnt look like there are any bay doors on the bottom to access the SSD or RAM and the batter is a built in job, not easily replaceable (if at all). It is unclear if the laptop has the 8GB included soldered in or in 1 of 2 ram slots. Its also unclear, but I expect that there is an empty 2nd ram slot (as most documentation seems to indicate it can be upgraded to 16GB by the user, just not how). I would imagine this would require removing the 8 or so screws on the bottom and maybe even using a pry tool to unsnap some plastic fasteners are the edges.For the price I was unable to find a laptop with everything I was looking to compete with this. I wanted a 13"" or smaller 1080 touchscreen with an 8th gen CPU, 250GB+ SSD, 8GB+ DDR4 RAM. This was the best deal I could find at the time including that ($709). There are tradeoffs with that. Some of what you dont get are:* USB type-c* Thunderbolt 3* NVMe PCIe SSD* Metal body* Higher resolution screenI would say this is a great machine for anyone who wants something small and portable with decent specs and that doesnt require a ton of storage or super demanding tasks (CAD, 3d rendering, advanced photoshop, extrmely large databases/spreadsheets, etc.) or gaming.Linux:I am now using Linux at work alot and learn best by giving myself a practical purpose to do something. I wanted to entrench myself in Linux at home while having something that was modern, aesthetically pleasing, functional, practical and portable.Prior to getting this laptop I tried about about 10+ distros and decided that; a) I liked KDE Plasma as a desktop environment best and b) I like Manjaro Linux as a distro the most.I didnt get this to do development type work from or anything like that. This is meant to be my ""daily driver"", its what I will use every day to browse the web, check email, work on documents, watch media, do some minor photo/video editing, occasionally run a VM, etc.I downloaded the 17.0.6 Manjaro KDE ISO and setup an USB3 drive to install from. Booted from the drive and ran installer which took about 5-10 mins which is on par or maybe slightly faster than I would expect for a Win 10 install using the same hardware/specs.Out of the box all of the drivers where recognized and working. Here are a couple things I was worried about and can confirm all working:* Qualcomm AC Wifi (will add model later, not handy right now).* Qualcomm Bluetooth* Touchscreen* Keyboard Backlight* Webcam (both standard and infrared lol)* GPU drivers for Intel* Screen Brightness* SoundI have not yet found any part of the hardware not working as intended.Battery life appears to land me at about 6+ hours of steady use so I am very happy with it.Software wise, most things just work. I have had to, as with any linux distro, troubleshoot and work out some kinks but nothing I can even recall as worth mentioning.At the end of the day, this is the first time I have felt like I really own the computer. KDE especially allows a level of customization I could only dream of in Windows. This is coming from someone who not only likes Windows 10, but previously worked for a company for 6 years with MS partnership in which we provided remote and on site support for many of their products including Windows and Office. I've developed professional course material and classes on Windows and taught the classes. I have defended Windows 10 fiercely at times. I have Windows Server 2016 Essentials at home and 3 other Windows 10 Pro computers on the domain with it.Why say all this about Windows? If someone like me can escape MS's strangle hold so can you. If you have considered moving to Linux this laptop is a great choice. However, dont take my word for it. Do your research, decide what distro and make sure it will work with whatever you install it on.EDIT (11/20/2017): So it appears the RAM and SSD can be upgraded. To do so requires removing the bottom of the laptop (roughly 8-10 screws and using a pry tool to unhinge the plastic tabs). Crucial shows upto 32GB (2x 16GB) RAM and guarantees compatibility. The SSD is a 2.5"" SATA SSD 7mm height, so m.2 drives will NOT work and especially not PCIe/NVMe drives. I havent upgraded myself as I have no need to now.EDIT (01/02/2018): For anyone concerned with firmware/BIOS updates while using Linux I have done a Intel ME Firmware update and a BIOS update (1.3.2).For the Intel SA-00086 advisory and update Dell has a page listing all model affected with links to their updates (a link to it is posted on Intel's official page for the advisory). In this case I used a Windows to Go drive to boot to Windows 10 without altering the installed setup on my machine. I had to install drivers to Intels ME and reboot. I then ran the update from Windows to Go and then shutdown and booted back to Manjaro KDE to verify the results via the script Intel provides and it returned that the issue was patched. Be aware booting from Windows to Go wouldnt be needed if running Windows already.The BIOS is actually easier. You just put the BIOS update exe on a thumb drive and plug it in, boot and press F12 to get the boot menu, select BIOS update. Browse to the update file on the thumb drive and run the update. I havent seen any other firmware udpates related to the laptop but if there are others I will likely use a Windows to go drive to do so unless its specifically a BIOS update.**Upgraded machine!!!I have since purchase changed the wifi card and upgraded the RAM. I did this as the QCA6174 wifi card made by Qualcomm isnt exactly Linux friendly. It worked, but had 2 major issues. Slow SMB xfer and it would report wifi connecting at 6 MiB/s (incorrectly). I bought an Intel 8265 which is officially supported for use in Linux brand new for $20 and works perfectly.I figured while I had it open to add another stick of RAM so I bought an 8GB stick of crucial RAM Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824A and it worked perfectly. To be honest the RAM upgrade wasnt even needed, but didnt want to break it open just to change the wifi card out. I considered an SSD upgrade as well, but I have like 200GB free of the 256GB so I am not exactly hurting for space.Also using this bluetooth mouse Logitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse, Long Range Wireless Mouse with Hyper Scroll and Easy-Switch up to 3 Devices - Navy which plays very nicely connected via bluetooth. Latest stable Manjaro update even adds its battery status to the battery notification area! Really like this mouse.Would still highly recommend this laptop as I am sure it will serve me for years to come."	2	7	3	3	6
I like the laptop. Light wt, touch screen is excellent with good resolution, super quiet, SDD is amazing ( first time owning one). Fast enough with me running photoshop 2017. Overall good laptopCONS :- plastic build, could have been more sturdy- camera is ok ok. although tbh, no one really uses it these days- fan vent is located facing down, cant keep on the bed or on lap.	2	7	3	3	6
I'll be honest in saying I'm pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to love this laptop as much as I did. After my tablet finally died I wanted something more versatile, and was thinking detachable keyboards would be the way to go. Saw this for the right price and decided to give it a shot. I'll never buy a 2-in-1 that can't swivel, ever. Can rotate it to any angle, adapts right away to tablet mode. It's a solid little powerhouse that can get a bit hot, but that's expected. Low storage isn't a huge issue. You can keep most things on another homegroup computer and keep the essentials local. Overall, great laptop for the price	2	7	3	3	6
Light, feels sturdy. great screen. Has been a wonderful laptop so far. I spent a little more to get the solid state drive instead of a traditional disk. Less storage, but as one reviewer pointed out much lighter.	2	7	3	3	6
I bought this to replace a Dell XPS 13 that died suddenly. While it doesn't have the fancy aluminum case, thin bezel and carbon fiber hand rest of the XPS, this Inspiron has a newer 8th generation processor, twice the SSD space, a touch screen and nice form flexibility. I got it all set up and have found that it has a good looking screen, reasonably fast performance for a laptop and I like the ability to use it as a laptop or as a tablet.The performance and strong features for a price point of just $650, make this a very attractive choice if you are looking for a laptop of this size.	2	7	3	3	6
I bought this laptop in December'17. My laptop started having issues a very few months after purchase (its still in warranty for quite some time). The laptop kept powering off and then not starting back-on (or no display) despite several tries and showed random behavior (i had to reset the OS too, losing all my data). Ultimately there came a time when the laptop shut off with no LEDs turning on and the laptop would not power-on no matter what. I had to FedEX ship my product to their Houston site after making a long customer delivery call. I got back my laptop in a week (with the motherboard replaced). However, ever since, it has battery issues (ie. the battery drops from 50%+ to 6% within a minute) making it impossible to work with the laptop unless connected to a power source. I have never seen a Dell laptop to have misbehaved so much, it really hinders all your work.	2	7	3	3	6
I absolutely love this product. It is light, and ideal for traveling with. Has a SSD with more than adequate storage for my needs, more than enough RAM, more than enough CPU speed/performance for everything I do. Battery life is ~ 7h. The network connectivity chip of this PC is a welcome change from my last PC (an HP which struggled with connecting to Wifi). This laptop immediately locks in to the nearest WiFi extender in my home - or any other WiFi I connect it to. LOVE the back-lit keyboard (my MUST-HAVE feature). Just the perfect PC for me. Very happy - No hesitation recommending this product.	2	7	3	3	6
Love this fast light weight computer. I use Corel draw on it and heavy duty embroidery software. Fast and easy	2	7	3	3	6
"This is one great laptop. Amazing tech stuff, memory and all. No doubt about it. The touchscreen is pretty good and I can't see how it could be better. The resolution is perfect (especially for a 13"" screen). I know some will complain about how the screen could fit more the size and stuff like that, but this is a 2in1 laptop. You're supposed to have somewhere to hold if you're in tablet mode. Keep that in mind. I think the only thing that could be better is the touchpad. After a few changes in windows options, I managed to find a pretty good balance, but it's not yet perfect."	2	7	3	3	6
Good tablet for a good price. With the new generation processors introducing cheap and affordable quad cores, the Tablets of 2018 are much stronger than 2017.	2	7	3	3	6
I like this laptop a lot. Only problem is it gets a tiny bit louder when its charging but its not crazy loud, definitely bearable. Windows 10 is a little crazy sometimes but as a whole I'm very happy with this product.	2	7	3	3	6
Be careful if you purchase this. I tried to upgrade the OS from Windows 10 Home to Pro. I spent the extra $135 on the upgrade but no matter what I did it wouldn't work.	2	7	3	3	6
I love it! I can take it anywhere & switch into tablet. It’s light so I can carry around.	2	7	3	3	6
Very good laptop. There are a lot more better laptops out there, but this was the best for quality/price. I'm happy with this purchase.	2	7	3	3	6
so far, I love it	2	7	3	3	6
Received the computer very quickly and it has been as expected so far. That said, it came with absolutely zero paperwork of any kind. Literally nothing. No confirmation of any software that the software installed is legitimate. Contacted Amazon support and they confirmed it was a new machine purchased from Dell by Amazon and sold to me - but unfortunately they had no proof of licensure that could be provided. First time I have purchased a computer using Amazon and I intentionally bought from Amazon directly. Hard to believe this was the answer but it is what it is I guess.

BACKGROUNDI’m not that old but I got interested in computers early on. I was the first of my friends who owned a personal computer and one of the first owners of what could truly be called a laptop. Back then the name Dell conjured up an image of something kluged together in someone’s dorm room and it was years before I could take them seriously.Fast forward to today when I’ve owned so many PC’s I’ve lost count and my personal laptop is a large-screen Dell gaming machine that may be the most advanced laptop I’ve ever owned. Needless to say these days I have no issues when I hear someone say dude you’re getting a Dell.This one is at the edge of modern technology and thankfully for me has what it takes to use in my business in a much smaller and lighter form factor than my big Dell gaming laptop and as a bonus adds a touch screen, which to me is more than just a trivial nicety, as a graphic artist and pro photographer when combined with a PN338M active pen they are big selling points.OBSERVATIONSIt’s true that Dell laptops may not be carved from a single piece of aluminum and there is extensive use of plastics, but it all comes together to form a surprisingly well built and sturdy machine. The keys feel tight and accurate, the track pad that tends to be misunderstood if you don’t read how to customize it is better than average, and the 13.3” screen the ideal compromise between being big enough to be useful but small enough to keep the device small and portable - the entire laptop is not much larger than a sheet of paper and just over 3/4 inch thick.This laptop is the most lacking of status lights, switches or buttons I’ve ever seen. There is literally only one status light at the front edge that illuminates during charging or when the storage drive is accessing. The on/off switch is on the exterior side and is a push to activate button, which unfortunately could be pushed accidentally, especially if you store it in a soft laptop case. The only other button is an external rocker switch for the volume control. In terms of I/O ports my opinion is that what they have is adequate but not impressive but for me it’s all I need.SPECSAs far as specs, they speak for themselves, it runs my most intensive photo/video editing apps without hesitation (note that the stock 8GB RAM is easily user upgradable, which I upgraded to 16GB myself in a couple of minutes).DOWNSIDESOne thing is that at 3.5 pounds it’s not the lightest but I can forgive that because it does feel more rugged than some if the lighter models. Another is the lack of an optical drive which is simply a fact of life today and other than being a minor inconvenience for people like me who do graphics work I’d gladly give up the extra weight and use of space an internal optical drive would add.An observation that I wouldn’t exactly call a downside but definitely distorted is that they say it has a “sleek new design that emphasizes more screen and less bezel”. No that’s not true, what they’ve done is extend the glass that covers the screen all the way to the edge purely for cosmetics but under that glass is a totally normal 13.3” screen surrounded by large borders and a very thick border at the bottom. They had plenty of real estate to actually reduce the size of the bezel and use a larger screen – but they chose not to.Speaking of design, the entire design philosophy of this laptop is that it can be used in multiple configurations. That sounds really nice on paper but in real life use it turns out to be not all sunshine and rainbows. When used as a typical laptop (on your lap) the two audio speakers are on the bottom and face right into your lap, muffling the sound. Even when on a desktop the sound is muffled. And the fan, the value of which is questionable since my much larger Dell laptop doesn’t have one, and the one in this unit is weak, also faces downward into your lap. When you prop it up like an easel the keyboard faces downward on the desktop, supported by only four tiny rubber feet. The feet are all toward the top of the keyboard so if you press too hard when using the touchscreen the entire laptop rocks backward. When you use the laptop in a tent mode, there are no plastic or rubber feet along the edge that sits on the desktop (the front edge that faces you when used as a normal laptop). This doesn’t cause any major problems except that that painted plastic edge is subject to a lot of wear and tear and eventually looks really bad. And finally, if you want to use it as a tablet, well let’s just say it is awkward because any or all of your fingers that are holding on to the back of the unit are pressing against the keyboard, which is not a good thing for obvious reasons.I can’t help but mention one particular flaw that it seems they could have done something about which is that their own preloaded update app isn’t smart enough to know when Windows is in the process of doing an update (which is pretty often). This is especially true when your unit is brand new and the first thing Windows does is brings it up to date with endless updates that can last for hours. Unfortunately Dell’s update app doesn’t respect that and barges in trying to do their own updates at the same time, the worst of which was just as Windows was finishing a major version update, they decided to flash the BIOS without asking me (which is a sensitive and major task during which absolutely nothing else should be running). This caused Windows to roll back and undo everything it took almost an hour to do. I’m lucky that the BIOS update didn’t fail and brick the entire computer. For them to permit such a conflict in software design is inexcusable.NITTY GRITTYI don’t take sides when it comes to the PC vs Mac debate. I own both plus an iPad, and I use them daily. Both can be equally adept for people who work in the graphic arts with a lot of it boiling down to personal style and work habits. With all that in mind I have certain editing specialty apps that I want to use that are PC only and I have yet to finds a PC equivalent to my iPad Pro that lets me do pen based editing on a touch screen. This computer is that bridge for me and has enough power and resolution (not the best but good enough) that I decided to load it up with all of my photo and graphic apps and dedicate it as my personal workstation.SUMMARYIts biggest downside is how much it costs, it would be a strong contender at under 500 bucks but there are too many better options above the 700 buck mark that make you wonder what they were thinking listing it so high. One impressive plus is that this model has wonderfully easy and well documented accessibility for upgrading memory, storage, battery and just about everything else, something the pretty, trendy (and expensive) models from some other brands have as a strike against them.The unit I’m I just got in early 2018 was made in late 2017 and is identified as a unit intended for Ireland and some of the user forums imply that it has already been discontinued. It’s been difficult to verify that from the manuf because it is difficult to pin down exactly what the details are for any specific model from their info.If some of this sounds like I don’t like it, that’s not the case, it may not be as cutting edge as the price would suggest but the conservative design of Dell laptops has served me well previously and I have positive vibes that this one will as well. Sure this laptop rides at the upper end of the budget considering its specs but I think you get what you pay for, and dressed in that unique Theoretical Gray color it has the look of success written all over it.	2	7	3	3	6
I didn’t like anything because it is224 gb but I ordered and paid price for 256 gb. It’s battery doesn’t run 2 hours also. I m cheated. I have starred just to submit.	2	7	3	3	6
This laptop didn't have many reviews, but I took a chance because I believed Dell to be of good quality based on reputation. Everything about it sounded great. Nice size, weight, resolution, battery life, number of ports, etc. All fantastic on paper.Then it arrived.I was excited to have a 2-in-1, so I immediately started using it in tablet mode, and I was greatly enjoying it. It all seemed like it was going to be fantastic. But then I decided to start testing it out in laptop mode and doing some browsing and reading, and let me tell you that this has the worst touch pad I have ever had the displeasure of using. Ever.If you are familiar with modern laptops, then you know the usual features. You use two fingers together and run them up and down to scroll. You spread two fingers away from each other to zoom out and pinch them together to zoom in. When these features work independently of each other, it all works great.However, that is not so with this piece of trash.The problem is that the touch pad is incapable of consistently differentiating between the two touches. For instance, imagine that you want to read a PDF at 100% zoom. You would imagine that that you could simply run your index and middle fingertips vertically across the touch pad, and then everything will scroll accordingly while maintaining 100% zoom. Not with this laptop. It constantly ends up thinking that the movement of your two fingers is a command to zoom, rather than a command to scroll. No matter how close I keep my two fingertips together, it inevitably ends up mixing in a zoom in/out command when all I want to do is scroll up/down. It doesn't matter how much or in what way I adjust the sensitivity -- it keeps on zooming when I am just trying to scroll.If you are in tablet mode, it's great. If you are using an external mouse, it's great. But if you want to use the touch pad, then forget about it. This is a completely useless product due to the laziness and lack of quality control that went into programming the touch pad. In 2018, this is absolutely unacceptable.How can the designers of this product have the gall to sell it with this atrocious touch pad? Are you people really so shameless?Dell has really fallen off the wagon, and I will never buy another Dell product ever again, nor will I ever recommend Dell to anyone ever again. Thanks for wasting my time, Dell.	2	7	3	3	6
I have been using this computer for a few weeks now and I am happy with it so far. Everything I tested has worked flawlessly.Intel i5-8250U processorIt is a mid-range processor, quite adequate for most home uses including picture and video editing. Don't just assume that i7 is more powerful than i5 because many i7 processors are much inferior compared to this i5 processor. Always compare the processor performance benchmark numbers on PassMark CPU Benchmark site before concluding one way or the other. According to PassMark numbers, this i5-8250U CPU is not bad at all.8GB memoryWhile 4GB is enough for most home uses like browsing, email, word processing, spreadsheets, etc., 8GB is preferred if you plan to do occasional photo editing and normal video editing (using, say, Microsoft MovieMaker). Any serious video editing may require more memory.256GB SSDWhile solid state drives offer you much better performance for read/write operations, they also come with a smaller capacity. It will help with quick boot up and wake from sleep or hibernation. Also, it will help with quick shutdown, sleep, and hibernation. Obviously, copying pictures and videos from your camera/camcorder/phone will be very fast too. However, a regular hard drive for a similarly priced laptop would have been 1TB or larger. Personally, I don't need a larger drive because I regularly take double backups and delete from the computer.ScreenBeautiful and sharp screen. I am very satisfied.Built-in speakersI am not impressed by the speakers. They are on the bottom surface of the keyboard and don't produce good sound. Expect to use headphones or external speakers. I would recommend external wireless blue tooth speakers.Blue toothWorks well. Sound quality depends on your headset or speakers.Touch padI didn't have any problems with the touch pad. I could easily perform all gestures supported by Windows 10 and the system performed well.WirelessWorked well as expected and didn't notice any problems.Touch screenWorked well as expected and didn't notice any problem. I tested with Windows Paint 3D app and everything worked just as you would expect.Weight and sizeVery comfortable in all respects. Thin, light, and easily portable.Power adapterI like the fact that the brick is small and easily portable in a bag.Other/miscellaneousPower button is a little too small and hard to operate.Camera works fine. Windows 10 face recognition (for logging into the system) works very well and extremely convenient.Fully articulated hinge allows this computer to be placed like a tent or make it a tabletI wish it came with a display port, but only HDMI is offered2 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port are available. I wonder why not all USB 3.0 ports.	2	7	3	3	6
I am so excited with this laptop. It is a medium to high end Intel laptop that comes with Windows 10. I have used Dell equipment in the past and in my opinion, they are not sexy as some others, but were work horse that are solid and reliable. My main computer now is a Mac (yes I am in the Apple orbit), so often times I compared other computers to Apple standard. This is one of the rare times I am excited about a laptop that was not from Apple.To start with, the screen is gorgeous. High resolution (1920x1080) and deep color, this makes everything beautiful from reading a magazine to watch movie a wonderful experience. Intel I5 and 256GB SSD help make the computer really fast. 8GB is so so, I wish I have more but for now, it seems sufficient. The whole computer is a bit heavier and bulkier than some other in the same class, but I believe there is a good reason for that: Touch Screen!It took a little bit to get used to, and I do worry that I will get used to this and start touching other laptop's screen! Think of a giant tablet with a keyboard attached. The screen is very responsive, browser windows closes or navigate nicely, just a light touch. I worried for a minute that my finger is too big for the screen, but that was not the case. The screen navigate just like an iPad, awesome! Of course, if you don't want to use the touch screen, the keyboard and touch pad let you operate like a regular laptop. Indefinite viewing position too.The laptop comes generously with 3 USB and a HDMI port, so you can actually hook to your TV and make it a media center. One thing that is different (and it took me a minute to figure out): the power on button is on the bottom right side instead of keyboard side.Over all, I am excited about this laptop and have used it regularly. My MacBook Pro is kind of gathering dust right now.	2	7	3	3	6
Got this on sale for $650 at my local microcenter. Was looking for expandable ram and quad core i5, this happened to be the heapest option for what i was looking for. Its a great machine, fast and smooth, havent had any issues so far. Its light and easy to carry, Its made of plastic with a 1080 display, the screen has some good viewing angles.The ram is supposed to be easily expandable(pull off the back and you can plug in your card) comes with two slots, one for the 8gb and a free upgrade slot.One of the biggest reasons i like this is the facial detection feature built in. Just turn on your laptop and look at the screen and your in. No messing with passwords or fingerprint sensor, its really fast like the password isnt even there.Only concern is the fan kicking in and machine getting pretty warm (79c), hoefully it doesnt become too much of a problem, but ive had this machine for a few weeks now and has only heated up twice. This is my first dell machine and its actually been one of the better laptops ive used. I would recommend buying this.	2	7	3	3	6
"In many ways I really like this computer, but the terrible battery life and other issues bump it down to a three star product.So what do I love about it? It's super light, set-up was a snap, screen resolution is great, the flip function (tablet mode) works overall very well with the hinge being easy to maneuver, but tight enough to hold the angle you want. The touch screen works well, the keyboard feels great. I am not a huge windows fan, but I can't bump down the rating due to that.Now here are the things that I don't love: The speakers are on the underside of the computer. To me, this makes the audio sound a little odd, especially when it's in tablet mode. When in tablet mode, the main volume control is on the back flip, so that can be a little awkward. I also don't love that the power switch is right next to the volume control switch. I know they tend to be placed next to each other, and I really don't understand why since you will undoubtedly accidentally hit the power when aiming for the volume. Another weird design issue is when you put it in tablet mode the ""DELL"" logo is upside-down. I don't care that it's upside-down, but it was just a funny design flaw that we noticed. Most importantly, the battery life is bad, especially if you are watching videos. It does charge pretty fast though, but I often find myself having to plug it in to watch a video. Another thing I noticed is that it can get very hot, which I recognized when it was in laptop mode and it was sitting on my lap. It has gotten so hot that it was quite uncomfortable and I had to move it off or lift it up for a while. When it does heat up, the fan will turn on, and it's pretty loud. The fan also turns on way more than any other computer I've ever had. It mostly seems to turn on when watching videos.To recap, I love the flip function, touch screen and how lightweight it is. I don't love the terrible battery life, some bad design issues and tendency to run hot."	2	7	3	3	6
I have been using this laptop for the past few weeks and have nothing but great things to say about it!! For the past several years, I have been using an iMAC desktop, but there were times I wished I had a laptop, so I wouldn't be tied to my desk.The Dell Inspiron has been great. The laptop is very thin and lightweight. Very sleek looking and easy to throw in a carry all bag or computer sleeve and run out the door. Set up was very easy and took about 20 minutes. Following the prompts made it basically effortless to get up and running. One of the features that is new, is the facial recognition to sign in. User looks into the screen and the computer picks up on features to sign them in. You can also have a backup passcode to enter if your face is not recognized. This is nice if you are the main user but have someone else in the household that would occasionally use the laptop.The battery life has been good. It has been disconnected for about 4-5 hours, laptop was connected to wireless internet and Microsoft running and still the laptop had battery to give before it was plugged back in. The bottom of the computer did get pretty warm on my lap while I was resting it there work on it. I eventually moved the la top to the coffee table because of the heat. Once connected back to the power source, the battery charges very quickly. It was back up to 100% power in no time. That is great if your run your battery low and don't have time to sit and wait for a recharge.Some of the features that took some time to get a hang of, but I ended up loving, were the touchpad and the touchscreen. The touchpad is very sensitive. While typing if you hover close enough to the touch pad it will move the mouse and change your screen. For the first few days that was very frustrating, but once I figured out how to adjust my hands to stay off the pad, it has not happened very much, if at all. The sensitive touch pad is actually something I like now that that I have learned how to control and navigate with it. I can quickly jump from screen to screen or to text within a document.The other new addition to the laptop that I have not had previously is the touchscreen option. That is great!! Having the ability to move around on the screen by touching the actual screen is outstanding. You can use the touchscreen feature while in laptop mode or flip the screen over and have in tablet mode. It takes virtually 1 second to transition the laptop to a tablet.For having a laptop that is for personal use, mostly email, online, and Microsoft office this laptop is perfect. It is fast, lightweight and easy to use. There are so many features that we haven't even touched on yet but I can't imagine that I won't also like those once I get to needing them. I am by no means a computer person or guru but I have been working on a computer for many years and this is by far one of the best laptops I have used!!Very happy with this product and recommend it highly.	2	7	3	3	6
"This review covers the i5379 etc. etc. since Amazon seems to lump reviews for different models together. Dell's unfortunate naming schemes don't help either.In case you hadn't noticed, notebook computers have gone off the deep end lately, trying to prove they're all sorts of things they're not, like tablets, or the ridiculous ""tented"" device you see in the product image. We get it, nearly every laptop has hinges that are fully articulated now. It's neither novel nor particularly useful most of the time. Let's get on with it.As a laptop, this is pretty decent. It has slim, ""ultrabook"" dimensions, although I think a proper ultrabook is at least somewhat metal/magnesium alloy in construction rather than plain plastic. The build quality of this laptop is fair, but nothing more. It feels a lot better than a $300 device, but is well behind a $1000+ device. For what Dell is asking I believe they could have tried a little harder on this front. However, it feels solid, has a nice screen, and the keyboard is tolerable. It's a decent lower-mid-range notebook. I don't like the massive bezel along the bottom of the screen (it's the one you see the upside-down ""Dell"" logo on the top of the tented version), and wish the screen format was just a little taller to actually use that real estate. The screen is otherwise quite good, though, and the touch screen is very responsive.A lot of the cost comes from the inclusion of the newest 8th-gen Core i5 processor. I have found it to be a pretty capable mobile processor, which handled my photo editing software well enough (although the 13"" screen is too small for proper editing, it works in a pinch) and is fast and smooth for loading lots of browser tabs, streaming video and other notebook things. It's not a gaming rig, of course. I do find the fresh and up-to-date Windows 10 OS boots exceptionally quickly and is responsive and easy to use.Overall this device is a curious mix of old and new. It's a mid-range Dell notebook, and as such is made with some sub-par materials and build quality. that's the old. The new is that, unfortunately, it tries to be hip by (literally) standing on its head. It's a fast and light notebook that will handle most of what you throw at it, but please for the love of all that's good, don't flip it upside down and stare that that upside-down Dell logo while you're streaming Netflix. It's a laptop, people."	2	7	3	3	6
Update (5/22/18): the keyboard stops working mid game and I have to restart the computer, the computer is overheating (it got up to 152 degrees Fahrenheit), and the speakers aren't great. I called Asus and they said to send this one back. I ordered from a 3rd party seller so I may try directly from Amazon and get a cooling pad.First, I am a World of Warcraft gamer. I did a good amount of research on laptops. I am coming from a Lenovo Y700 15-ACZ. I chose this laptop because a) it was recommended by my gamer friends to get an Asus b) the larger SSD is good for the OS and the game since they are both large files. I also wanted the speed from the SSD c) sacrificed on the 1060 graphics but the 1050 is much higher than what I have now and looks great d) the keyboard is awesome!!! No more boring red keys. I checked this out at a best buy store before I purchased.Update after 2 weeks of use: Graphics are beautiful on the 1050 (I do not regret not spending the extra $$ for 1060 graphics). Loading screens are so fast and the game refreshes so much faster!! Trackpad is better (although I use a mouse). Took getting used to the font on the keyboard but that took just a couple of days. Big upgrade from my Lenovo. I did experience my keyboard/mouse locking up for a few seconds in WoW during a mythic+ but I think this had to do with the overlay from Discord or having to update the driver (went to geforce's website-- here you can download their program and optimize based on your game). The battery isn't the greatest but I don't mind since I play near an outlet and I'm not sure how much battery someone could expect out of a gaming laptop anyway. Yes the laptop gets loud at times but that is because it is using the fan so it does not give out! I am happy with my multi purple backlit keys :)	3	7	5	8	0
"I bought this notebook while my daughter was in USA. Since I live in Brazil, she brought it to me 2 weeks ago. I'm not a gamer, I'm a software developer, so I need a fast machine to do my daily work, and gamers notebooks usually fits this requirement. I was an ASUS fan back in the 90's, when I used to assembly desktop machines with parts from different brands. ASUS was my preferred brand for the motherboards in that time, so I supposed that ASUS notebooks would provide the same quality that I was used to, back in those days. Well, it seems that my expectations was too high. The machine is fast, of course, but I faced two problems that I would like to share: When you ""click"" in the touchpad, it is like there is something loose inside that hits the plastic chassis mostly where you stand your wrist, causing an weird sensation. The other problem is a ""high frequency"" noise coming from the notebook when the CPU is under some load. I searched the online forums, and this sound seems to be pretty common in ASUS notebooks, and they call it ""coil whine"" sound. It seems to be harmless, but very annoying. The loose touchpad also seems to be common for those notebooks. Unfortunately, ASUS warranty does not cover Brazil, so seems that I'll have to live with those problems. They are not showstoppers, but they should not exist at all in a quality product. Another problem was regarding the (mostly useless) ASUS support. I replaced the original SSD with a (higher capacity) Samsung EVO 970, meaning that I had to do a fresh install of Windows 10. I downloaded all the drivers from ASUS site, but I wasn't able to install the touchpad driver. In the end of the install, it always raised an error. I contacted ASUS support by chat, and they gave me all kind of useless answers, like installing ASUS live, send it to RMA (in my case, this would not be possible), etc. I was sure that there was no hardware problem, since the touchpad worked fine in the bios setup screen, and also worked fine in the pre-installed Windows on the original SSD. It took me more than a day digging into forums, etc until I finally found that I had to install the Intel I/O driver before installing the Precision touchpad driver. This wasn't mentioned anywhere. This solved the problem, but I wonder how ASUS support missed this information! So, I wonder if buying an ASUS notebook was the best choice..."	3	7	5	8	0
Great laptop, very competent for gaming and casual use. Love the 256GB SSD + 1TB combo - startup is super fast. Passmark score of 4123 puts this in the 83rd percentile. The 16GB appears to be in a single slot, leaving room to expand (though not sure you would need more than 16GB). Outside - the laptop is not overly gamey. The lid has the ROG decal in silver - no screaming red logos on this one. the overall slim profile keeps it discrete. There are 5 USB ports, one USB-C, and a video port along with a LAN port.Keyboard is nice, with keys to directly control volume and quick launch the ROG Gaming Center app. The ROG Gaming Center is interesting. It allows you to setup upto 3 game profiles.Profiles allow you to configure the fan and display settings, as well as kill any extra running processes (antivirus etc.), so that you free up more memory for the game. You can apparently control the Game Center via an android app on a phone, but did not try that. Keyboard has RGB backlights, that you can control with ROG Aura. Some basic options are available. I have seen some laptops that can change keyboard color based on CPU temps etc., that did not seem possible with this, but did not fully explore.Battery life is okay. Its a HQ processor, not known for power efficiency. You get about 2.5 hours without gaming. Running games and putting the fan in overboost mode will bring this down.The only area that is a little irritating with this laptop is the installed bloatware. Things keep popping up trying to make you buy stuff, create accounts, upsell, etc. If you find those apps useful, you might not mind it. I found them irritating. I am especially not crazy about how intrusive McAfee can be.	3	7	5	8	0
Have had this laptop for 1 day, I really like it. A 1-day review is usually frowned upon but Im going from a high end pc (1080 ti, 7th gen i7, etc) to this for work related reason and this thing is really impressive for a laptop. Its geared toward moba's but offers more than just that with the 1050 ti built in, and the 6 core i7 8th gen is a really great aspect. I can have a lot going on with a very slight lag that doesnt bother me (unclocked).I havnt played any games yet that are graphic intensive but my geforce program auto set a lot of my really nice games that are mostly about the scenario to mostly high settings with some being really high/ultra. Everything about the laptop feels nice. Im glad I bought it.	3	7	5	8	0
This order was a Christmas present for my daughter. This item was the only thing on her Christmas list, literally. I was very impressed that I ordered it on Thursday morning and it was here the very next morning! She is thrilled with this machine! She loves to game with her friends and she has been raving about this computer since she opened it on Christmas morning! I don't know if it is allowed, but perhaps she can write an in depth review of the product itself, rather than the transaction?	3	7	5	8	0
Had for a few months now and it's been a great gaming laptop! Get a cooling pad though, this sucker can get pretty hot.	3	7	5	8	0
This laptop is great so far.The lid seems less sturdy than the bottom half of the chassis.I have been very gentle with it but I worry that I will accidentally pull on the lid too hardwhile trying to open it one of these days.I've only had this product for a month but I will update the review if anything notable should happen.	3	7	5	8	0
"<UPDATE>Changing the rating from 3 STARS to 2 STARS due to bad hardware compatibility.I found the cause of the hiccups and inconsistent frame rates as originally stated below. The combination of this Intel Chipset and Nvidia Chipset has reported issues almost like its a bug they can't fix. The 1050 isn't powerful enough to do most of the processing, so the i7 will enter (turbo mode) while your gaming to accommodate the lack of processing power. When this happens, your FPS will drop to a constant 30FPS. Once the switch to turbo is done, your frames will go back to normal. ""Usually took about 30 seconds. and would happen about every minute or so.""HOWEVER: If your game is new enough to where it enters turbo boost and stays in turbo boost - you wont have a problem. So this will only effect older/dated games. or if you have your laptop in performance mode and put the graphics all the way down for highest possible frames""</UPDATE>WARNING: If you are purchasing this laptop for gaming, be prepared to play all your games on the absolute lowest settings. Also, I received a laptop with bad speakers (uploaded video)I purchased this laptop thinking it was going to be an upgrade from my previous computer. Sadly that was not the case.My previous computer:i5-3750k8GB GSkill RAMGeforce 960 GTX4TB WD HDD240fps CSGO (with tweaked config)200fps Rocket League180fps Quake Champions85fps GTA V96fps PUBGRan flawlessly with no hiccupsThis laptop:180fps CSGO (with same config)150fps Rocket League75fps Quake Champions60fps GTA V50fps PUBGLots of hiccups and was very inconsistent and choppy.The i7 is not ideal for gaming, but performs well for multitasking programs.There was a lot of bloatware I had to remove in order to gain any type of performance boost.If you dont know how to turn off windows 10 xbox stream, on battery CPU power management, and nvidia laptop battery saver settings, your games are going to run at a solid 30fps or 60fps no matter what.This laptop is not a good gaming laptop for the price. I've had better gaming performance with a $700 Dell i5 Inspiron Laptop."	3	7	5	8	0
Well I decided to upgrade from my 650$ Dell Inspiron and am starting to regret it. Other than the 120hz screen, there is not a noticeable difference in performance. On top of that, There is a very annoying buzzing sound like one you'd hear during an AOL connection or something . I couldn't tell you where its coming from but I know its not the fans. All in all, If you're going to spend this much money on a laptop, don't spend it on this one.	3	7	5	8	0
I was looking for a computer with the juice to handle my data science demands and I found it in this gaming beast. The only gaming I'm doing in is tearing up data. It's beautiful too and the programmable lit keyboard is an awesome touch. So far it has exceeded my expectations.	3	7	5	8	0
The machine runs games great! Only thing is it came with a malfunctioning keyboard which really made me disappointed.	3	7	5	8	0
I just got the laptop today and have finally customized and installed everything I need on it (aside from all the games I want). I am a Computer Science major and avid PC game player so this laptop will be perfect for me. The laptop I had before this one was another ASUS ROG, I believe it was the GL551JM. It had Intel i7, GeForce GTX 960m, 1TB HDD, and 256GB SSD. So really the only upgrade I went for with a new laptop was the new processor, graphics card, and overall design. So far I love this design of the laptop, it feels very sturdy and comfortable and honestly it is quite sexy and slim. I was so happy when I took it out of the box. Another reason I upgraded laptops was because I had my previous one for about 3 years and the motherboard was giving out, the display wouldn't always turn on so I had to power on and off the laptop until it did. Occasionally the screen would have a glitch of pink lines coming up from the bottom of the screen. So it was in due time of getting a new laptop. I do hope this one will last longer than my last one, I will be sure to take extra care of this one too. It doesn't help that I commute back and forth from school with the laptop but this new one is slimmer and lighter than the last.	3	7	5	8	0
In 2018, GTX 1050 is little not buy-worthy but for this budget, this is the best. Thin and awesome design. Fans are little loud when the gpu at max.Played far cry 5 High quality (not ultra) without a single problem except the fans are louder than expected. That is not a big problem if you use a headphone	3	7	5	8	0
I had bad experience with rog; the audio speakers were breaking when i raise the volume above 15%, I tried installing all the audio drivers but no luck. key board is not workings some times in the middle of the game, i had to restart every time it got stuck and over heating for just playing one game... its bad. I read lot of good reviews about asus rog but I had bad experience	3	7	5	8	0
It's handles many popular games such as Overwatch, Pubg, and Rainbow Six Siege really well( However on High/Ultra, it runs loud and hot.) and boots up almost everything really quickly. And the display is really nice, i can put it in a vast amount of different angles without any glares. Overall, very happy with my purchase	3	7	5	8	0
"This is a great MOBA laptop. It has just the right specs. The 1050TI is a perfect fit for MOBA Gaming. I like how the QWER keys are highlighted on the ""Hero"" edition unlinke the usual WASD. The 120hz is nicely done. This is a keeper. DOTA2 and Heroes Of The Storm HotS."	3	7	5	8	0
Perfect except than sometimes the keyboard stop function and I have to close the lid a few second to this function again	3	7	5	8	0
Been using it for 1 month now. Pretty much for gaming and work (container-managed software dev, etc).From a gamer's perspective:Pro:- sharp display- 120hz refresh rate- smooth keyboard- fast CPU & GPUCons:- as expected - gets hot - a little too hot sometimes (depending on the game, I guess)- touchpad could be a little betterSuggestions - it would be great if the screen opened out to: 180 deg	3	7	5	8	0
I just got mine yesterday, so far its been working great. I played a few games and they were smooth no stutters or anything. (Gta5) The screen is very very good very clear and colour accurate.	3	7	5	8	0
I am using this for college it has been great so far.	3	7	5	8	0
The laptop had good specs, but my laptop arrived damaged (Amazon sent me a bad item), I have had many troubles with this product, it does not work very well and others, I am not satisfied with this purchase. The item is very good.	3	7	5	8	0
Update May 2018: The laptop is pretty solid minus the failing drive mine shipped with. There was a mix up when the early review model was shipped to me so I received the wrong storage option. Asus support never responded to me despite multiple attempts to contact.TL;DR.. if you avoid the Single 1TB Hybrid Drive option, and utilize Amazon's return policy instead of ASUS support, it is a pretty solid gaming laptop. I swapped out the 1 TB Hybrid drive and problems went away. It is a very quick laptop with great graphic and CPU performance for the price.-----Things are not starting out well with this laptop. This is a new laptop so I do want to give ASUS a chance to address this. I will update this review as things develop.First of all, I was shipped the single 1TB spinning disk option (with the 8GB SSD cache built in, a.k.a the Seagate FireCuda 1TB), not the 256 SSD + 1TB HDD option I was supposed to review.I went to install some familiar games to run some benchmarks. I go away for a couple hours while the downloads run and come back to the machine crawling very slowly. I'm wondering why the download is going so slow and windows seems very sluggish, so I open up the task manager and find the hard drive is working really hard to keep up with a 2.5MB/second download. This is not at all normal behavior. I've attached a screen shot.I download Seagate's SeaTools utility and read the hard drive's diagnostic counters (SMART stats). SMART comes back clean (surprisingly), but the thing fails to complete even the short self-test, which clearly shows a failing drive. Another screenshot of that. A reboot changed nothing.Updated: Three contacts with ASUS support so far without any resolution.	3	7	5	8	0
I bought this computer and it did not come with a charger.Does this purchase come with a charger or not?	3	7	5	8	0
Touchpad is very bad. It have a sound when i touch and press on it.I hate the fan. It is very lound.	3	7	5	8	0

A workhorse laptop with a large, HD screen, 16GB memory, quad cores, backlit keyboard, and large hard drive makes for a solid gaming or development platform — even better, this ASUS ROG STRIX Thin and Light Gaming Laptop is also (relatively) lightweight! Let’s take a closer look.Here are the basic specs, and be sure to also see the included pics:* 16GB RAM* 15.6″ full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels)* Storage: 256GB SATA SSD and 1TB HDD drives* Dimensions:15.1 x 10.3 x 0.9 inches, and weighing in around 5.6 pounds* CPU: 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core 2.8GHz (Turbo to 3.8GHz) with discrete GeForce GTX 1050 4GB graphics* I/O: Bluetooth 4.1, 3x USB 3.0, 1x USB 3.1 (Type C), 1x USB 2.0, 1x HDMI, 1x Mini DisplayPort, 1x headphone/Mic jack, and 1x RJ45 LAN port, and 802.11ac 2×2 WiFi* Keyboard: Aura RGB lighting keyboard with 4 isolated hotkeys, 1.6mm key travel, and anti-ghosting technology. 4 zones of lighting control. 20-million keystroke durability.* DVD: As the current trend, there is no DVD drive. I’m now accustomed to that, so don’t miss it. You can connect USB to an external DVD (eg Apple DVD drive worked) if you must.The laptop comes with Windows 10 Home as the OS. Both MS Office and MS OneDrive came pre-installed but unactivated. I used Control Panel | Programs and Features to uninstall both products, as this is targeted to be a development machine. I installed Oracle’s VirtualBox to run virtual machines. With quad cores, this is a good host for VMs.There is a numeric keypad, which would be good for accounting and tax chores. I loved the backlit keyboard and the ability to change the backlit colors with the pre-installed ASUS app. The touch pad did not have individual buttons, but was more of a universal pad where when you click on the left it is a one-click and if you click on the right it is a double-click. It took me about thirty minutes to get used to it, but now I like it.Since there are two WIFI adapters, you can connect to WIFI, and also share that WIFI with other devices, creating a hotspot. No cellular though — wouldn’t that have been a dream?Regarding the 1.25TB of space: The space is 256GB of SSD on which the OS is installed, and 1TB of HDD space that is available for end-user storage. The 1TB drive is end-user replaceable.The display is a very crisp 15.6″ full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels). This is *not* a touch screen, although I keep trying.The logo that appears on the back of the metal (aluminum?) lid lights up. Although the lid is nice, the base of the unit is plastic.The lithium ion battery life is OK — generally I got less than five hours of varied use including installing software. This workstations does have quad cores after all, and you’ll definitely hear the fan when it kicks on. The power brick is huge (not great for travel), but it does tend to charge the laptop quickly (within two hours).All in all this is a fast Windows laptop that could serve as a solid gaming or development platform, and I’m happy with it.I hope you found this review helpful!	3	7	5	8	0
Great design in a little package. everything feels solid, with good materials all around. The 1 year of accidental damage warranty included is the icing on the cake!It is finally good to see ASUS adding an RGB keyboard to the gaming series, although I havent had time to play with the settings yet, the default lighting is pretty cool alreadyI bought this laptop for video editing and some various graphics design workI appreciate the fact that SSD is large enough for me to install my programs on it and there is also an HDD so I can store my video and processing files on that.so far the installation and opening of the adobe software are fastnext up is installing PUBGI havent ran any benchmarks yet, ill update this post when I do so. So far so good thoughNot experiencing what the previous 2 (Vine) reviewers have experienced, I got the 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD in my laptop and everything runs fine, no hiccups, no stuttering	3	7	5	8	0
"This is a pretty good laptop and does have all the specs described in the product listing. However, the problem is that the listing is intentionally vague when it comes to giving out the laptop's model number.The listing says, ""Item Model Number: HP PAVILION 15.6 TOUCH I5"", however as anyone knows who bothered to Google the term, this is not a real model number.This laptop's model number is actually 15-bs095ms and I encourage everyone to search Amazon and Google before buying. That way you can be sure you're getting the best prices. Right now (1/25/2018) there are other Amazon listings for this same laptop which are cheaper."	3	6	2	9	6
I just un-boxed this laptop. This laptop is incorrectly advertised on here. It has all of the correct specs however the model is not what they have listed in the description. The real model is 15-bs095ms, This same model is for sale in a few other places on amazon for a bit cheaper. Make sure you do some research on this model before you buy. I am liking it so far, but it is not the model that they list. I will update my rating as time progresses.	3	6	2	9	6
Ordered this as a replacement for a laptop that died after less than 2 months. So far I am loving it! Set up was super easy, and it is running beautifully.	3	6	2	9	6
Happy with my purchase! Came in brand new packaging and all is working well (including touch screen). Was able to look up HP limited warranty. Looks like a great machine. Will update my review if anything changes.	3	6	2	9	6
I’m having problems with the battery the laptop will not work unless plugged in I’ve asked for a customer support to contact me and I’ve never been contacted still waiting to be contacted can you provide me help	3	6	2	9	6
Product description did not match the computer. I put in a question about why the computer did nothave 1 of the 3 top features I bought it for.....NO RETURN MESSAGE WAS EVER RECEIVED FROM VENDOR.	3	6	2	9	6
It is slower my previous HP i-core 5 business laptop. It is a great device, smooth keyboard, nice look. Love it!	3	6	2	9	6
I checked the setting and it does not have touch screen!! It might be a nice laptop, but they have the wrong info from it. Also mine came from Stamples on the box but some other seller was on the invoice.Should have bought one right from HP. $200+ for the HP ENVY Laptop -15t touch	3	6	2	9	6
Started up right away instead of making me wait for it to update. No bloatware. None of the minor irritants I have had with other new PCs. Boots fast, so far no issues. I wanted the 2Tmemory for photos, and love that I have room to grow. It is fast enough for the few games I play. No issues.	3	6	2	9	6
I've only had this for 20 days, and now it wont turn on all the time. When it does, it is supper slow. When I went to return it, it wont let me because it states the return period has expired. HELP can't buy another laptop in just 20 days.	3	6	2	9	6
Not too impressed with the computer itself. From the time I started it up, it took between 5 to 10 minutes to go from a black screen to the home screen. Then after that I got a blue screen and the computer just seems to have a lot of issues that aren't worked out yet and I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it or not. Seems like just too many issues for brand new computer and then it just kept doing updates which a new computer shouldn't have to do that.	3	6	2	9	6
The laptop was extremely slow. did not give a feel of a new laptop. I am an IT professional and had to run heavy softwares and virtual machines. this laptop didnt work and i had to return it.	3	6	2	9	6
The HDD on this laptop is soooooo slow. It's a real bottleneck that will allow you down. Windows updates take hours. Programs that use lots of disk writes will slow you to a crawl. Other than that, it's a good laptop.	3	6	2	9	6
After about 25 minutes of updates, works great, nice touch screen. Sound from Speakers is Good but not Great. Nice clear screen. I dont do gaming so I can speak to speed but for standard usage this is good deal for the money.	3	6	2	9	6
This really is a little work horse. Very light. Touch screen is awesome. Quiet, easy to use. Very worth the money	3	6	2	9	6
Great laptop computer! Fast and has lots of memory and huge hard drive! 2TBs! So fast! Love it! Great price!	3	6	2	9	6
After fully updating this laptop. My girlfriend loves her new play-toy. This laptop worths like a charm for her. It isnt no gaming laptop or have the power and speed of a beast desktop. But for someone who uses it for work and home, it works great.	3	6	2	9	6
Really it was not what I expected, it is very slow to have a fast processor, the capacity of 2 TB occupy 1 TB and became slower, you could hear a noise like a loose piece inside the equipment, and it turned out to be a loose screw , that left me a lot to be desired, because I understand that in my country Guatemala, I do not have warranty coverage, it is likely that Windows 8 is faster, but Windows 10 is a turtle. I have an Acer I3 two generations earlier and it is much faster	3	6	2	9	6
Runs great and fast. Windows 10 had its usual issues with updates but that's not a fault of the laptop. The touchscreen is responsive but I don't think I will use that much.	3	6	2	9	6
I have had this laptop from etech for three months. It is totally locked up. will not function at all. I did not realize it was not sold by amazon.. I want to return but of course it is past the return period.	3	6	2	9	6
Don't buy this computer the battery doesn't last 4 hours. This is messed up!!!!!!	3	6	2	9	6
100% disc usage with no programs running. Re-installation, driver and bios updates, nothing helps. The computer has a massive lag even when it merely runs text processing programs. Complete waste of money and neither seller nor customer support are helpful. No HP product, ever again.	3	6	2	9	6
What can I say except it's a $500 laptop. Constantly freezes up and the touchscreen becomes unresponsive. They don't even tell you how to set the computer up. Needless to say, I spent about a half hour trying to get help with the problem from the oh-so-competent support staff. *sarcasm*, It's worth it to spend an additional 500-700 bucks on a brand new computer that doesn't act like it's about to die.	3	6	2	9	6
The battery died in 60 days. Tried to contact seller who has not responded.Hope they change their mind.	3	6	2	9	6
Bought this computer for my dad who doesn't do anything to really extensive. He loves it and has zero complaints that is why I'm giving it 5 stars also VERY speedy delivery during the holidays.	3	6	2	9	6
Very very very slow processor , I hate my laptop, very bad performance of lapy,	3	6	2	9	6
Bought this computer late January 2018, it's been running slower and slower and I've now found out the disc is 100% full when I'm not running any programs and have not been using this computer to store files. Complete waste of money and will not purchase from this seller ever again. This is the first time I've been let down buying through Amazon.	3	6	2	9	6
Very economical Laptop PC with adequate speed and features	3	6	2	9	6
Definitely enjoy. However the transfer of data from my other computer has been time consuming	3	6	2	9	6
Solid laptop for the price. For 8 gigs of ram and a dual core processor, it ran pretty slow in the beginning. I closed out some of the bloatware and it’s been solid. Still runs a bit slower than I expected, but overall it’s been decent. Speakers are good for a laptop. Video quality is pretty good as well.	3	6	2	9	6
I like the computer, however battery life might be an issue. I've never had a laptop before so have nothing to compare it to.	3	6	2	9	6
works great so far	3	6	2	9	6
Came brand new. Arrived on time. Laptop works great. Excellent purchase.	3	6	2	9	6
I bought laptop Dec 2017. Been out of town and didn’t open til a few days ago and getting info input. On the 3rd day It won’t even turn on. This is junk!	3	6	2	9	6
This computer was nothing but problems from the time I first started it until it was returned.	3	6	2	9	6
Windows 10 is too clever for this old man. Can I get it changed to a simpler and less fancy system? Windows 10 is driving me crazy, wasting time and generating anger and frustration	3	6	2	9	6
Will take too long to start and then slow like a turtle!! What a disaster HP is selling to loyal customers to loose market share!	3	6	2	9	6
My husband bought this for me and I absolutely love it. I'm still getting use to having a touchscreen. It's lightweight and perfect size.	3	6	2	9	6
This is a great laptop for the price. Love the touchscreen, it makes it easier to move between devices like smartphones and tablets by using the screen to navigate. Sound is decent and the screen looks good with pictures or videos.	3	6	2	9	6
I liked!	3	6	2	9	6
It is grwat very fast love it	3	6	2	9	6
It did everything that I wanted and performance was great	3	6	2	9	6
Must buy. Received on time. Excellent machine. Liked it a lot.	3	6	2	9	6
Great performance and reliability	3	6	2	9	6
Perfect for college bound.	3	6	2	9	6
Bought from another seller. LOVE it!	3	6	2	9	6
it had all that I expected though it is a bit slow.	3	6	2	9	6
It exceeds expectations and simple to use. Great buy!!!	3	6	2	9	6
Enjoy every minute of it. Good buy, don't regret it!	3	6	2	9	6
Great laptop	3	6	2	9	6
I like it is so big . The voice was so good	3	6	2	9	6
Great Laptop no complaints	3	6	2	9	6
I like the most!!!	3	6	2	9	6
Didn't come with a charger	3	6	2	9	6
Plenty cool.love it	3	6	2	9	6
could have a better graphics card, but frankly its not a bad pc.about two weeks in and nothing to complain aboutthe memory is NOT 2 tb. it's sata memory so it's only 1.8tb. regardless for the price its a great deal.I hope to make this computer last at least 7 years, i think it can do it if you take care of it and organize properly.I bought this computer for 477, about two days later i see it listed for 450, then the next day I see it listed at 495 with a bundle that comes with a mouse and bag for only 450. a bit confusing but I feel like i was looking at a different computer even though everything was listed the same.	3	6	2	9	6
Still learning Windows 10. Love having a full keyboard AND touch screen.Had no instructions on Win 10, so getting up to speed was slow.	3	6	2	9	6
I've had this lap top for over a month. It is so slow that I can't even check my email or move a file from my desktop to another folder in 30 minutes. I was going to factory reset it, but now it won't even turn on. Definitely $500 down the drain. 100% do not recommend this lap top at all.	3	6	2	9	6
I researched and researched and read reviews and more reviews until my head was spinning. I love my laptop. Good decision to buy this one. Its fast and easy to use. Set up was straightforward and simple. Love my laptop.	3	6	2	9	6
Wife still making transition. Working well.	3	6	2	9	6
sale very good staffs	3	6	2	9	6
I purchased this computer and the hard drive did not work properly. I returned it.	3	6	2	9	6
Technically Laptop meets description. Operates fast, boots fast and so on. But laptop made of plastic (feel like cheap plastic) and looks like it is very thin and fragile. Next moment i dislike is that screen can't lean backwards more then 45-50 degrees, which means when you work with laptop on your knees you can not see clear picture until u lean whole laptop backwards.	3	6	2	9	6
Love it is great!	3	6	2	9	6
I've had it for almost two weeks, I couldn't find a better one with 15 inches touch!	3	6	2	9	6
Working out very good so far, fast, easy set up, works great. Delivery was better then expected plus it was a day early then we thought, thank you!	3	6	2	9	6
I just got it a few days ago and already got the Hard disk (3FO). Ran all hard drive checks and still said it couldn’t find it. What a horrible purchase, I’ll be returning it	3	6	2	9	6
It's a great laptop. It would have been better with keyboard lighting. But I love it.	3	6	2	9	6
The actual computer specifications are different from the specifications in the advertisement .... The seller is not honest in the specifications	3	6	2	9	6
The battery lasted for only 2 hours and it glitched even when i tried to reset the laptop and it wont reset	3	6	2	9	6
Great computer but gets one star do to the fact it is suppose to be brand new and when I got it finger prints all over it and multiple keys on the key board do not work I don’t buy on amazon to get stuff that doesn’t work this was I very big let down as it was a gift , now won’t get it in time for Christmas.	3	6	2	9	6
don't waste your time... and don't buy it... I brought it and had to return it because I couldn't use this.	3	6	2	9	6
I received my Brand New HP i5 7200U from Amazon last March 4. I tried to open but it was not open, so I just assumed it was battery drained. So I charged it maybe more than a hour but still can't charge. The led light indicator also not working or have no light. What I did is immediately inform Amazon and seller that the unit I received is dead on arrival. And until now ( April 3, 2018) still they not working. All of their suggestions are useless and impossible:1. They advise me to return the item from Qatar to US. Unfortunately all of the carrier like DHL etc here in Qatar are not accepting laptop specially if it is defective.2. They advise me to repair at Authorized HP Service Center, and I did also, but they need the Valid Invoice in order to repair under warranty otherwise if without invoice they will repair under post warranty and I will pay for the cost. But seller (TECH & TOYS )and Amazon cannot provide me a VALID INVOICE. VALID INVOICE is the only way in order to repair without any cost at my side amounting $340. Just a piece of paper ( VALID INVOICE ) they wont provide.So just want to share my experience and reminders specially for those ordering outside US to think many times before you place your order to them. Possible it will happen.	3	6	2	9	6
"Its an OK laptop. I've been using it for about 3 months. Had an issue at start up, getting a 90B error which is a fan failure. Contacted HP support and they wanted to charge me $52 for a home visit to address the issue. I asked why I have to pay for this and they said its absolutely free.I just have to pay for the home visit. I replied $52 isn't free. I asked for other options and HP support said ""you can ship it back to us but you have to pay the shipping"". I asked if they could just ship me a new fan and I would install myself. They said sure it costs $45 plus shipping. I since took a look at the fan and the plug wasn't on correctly, reinstalled plug and haven't had had an issue since. I would look at other brands!"	3	6	2	9	6
I was nervous about ordering a computer online. It shipped quickly, was well-packed, and arrived in great condition. As a student, I was worried about being without a computer, but this one arrived in time to get some essential work completed!!! Thank you. The computer itself seems great. I have never set one up before and it gives prompts to guide you. I had fortunately backed-up my previous computer files on a thumb drive. They installed without issue.Thanks again for the amazingly fast service and what appears to be a nice computer.	3	6	2	9	6
Very disappointed, the keyboard randomly freeze by itself.	3	6	2	9	6
Warning, this computer does NOT come with a BACKLIT KEYBOARD! The description was misleading. Did not match the MODEL SENT!	3	6	2	9	6
Let me start off by saying that I did a lot of research into this model before deciding to buy, so I have no idea why other reviews are complaining about features not included. I strongly considered the Dell XPS 13 and similar ultrabooks in this price/feature range. I decided to go with the gram for a number of reasons, which include the ability to add RAM and storage.I have had it for a few days and I am extremely impressed with what LG has done with the latest version of the gram. After seeing previous models and having one or two things that really turned me off (the camera located by the hinge), I am thrilled to see that LG listened to customer feedback and made changes.The 8th generation i5 has proven quite fast and I have not had any issues with any of what I have thrown at it. Battery life is excellent, but I have not put the 22 hours to the test yet. I am currently on battery saver and at 75% remaining it says I have 17 hours and 25 minutes left. The fan isn’t silent on load but it isn’t crazy loud either – I would classify it as normal. I do like that the fan vent openings face to the rear of the computer (see video) instead of facing down. This allows it to stay cooler when it is being used on your lap, the air can escape.The fit and form of the laptop is top notch. It does not feel flimsy or cheap and does not flex or bend. I do not think that there will be any issues, it feels sturdy and well-made. The screen is sharp, clear, and plenty bright. I really like the keyboard and the touchpad. I think LG did a great job with the keys, they have just the right amount of travel. I would call the touchpad good, I have not had any issues with it so far. I also like the Fn buttons, particularly the keyboard backlight, touchpad on/off, and reader mode (reduces blue light).Unfortunately, the Windows 10 it came with had all kinds of bloatware. I attached the screenshot of the used space on the hard drive when I received it (35.6 GB) and when I formatted and put a fresh install of Windows 10 Home back on and added the LG drivers/software from the website (16.8 GB). The difference is crazy, I would recommend that everyone wipe their systems, reinstall Windows, and download the LG software. It saves a ton of space and give you a lot more control of what is on your system. This isn’t just advice for this particular laptop, but really any computer you buy these days.I did not want a fingerprint reader, I did not want an i7, I did not want a touchscreen. I wanted a fast, 8th generation, extremely portable computer for grad school and everything that comes with that (video chat, internet use, writing, etc.). I also wanted the longest possible battery life – which is why this model is perfect for me. So far it has delivered and I am extremely pleased with the new gram.I will update this review if anything changes.Pros:It is extremely lightUpgradeableIt is a great looking computerThe keyboard and touchpad are fantasticCons:No Fn key on the right side of the keyboard (personal preference)No Thunderbolt 3Bloatware (which all companies do these days)	2	5	2	3	6
Can't quite attest to the battery life yet, but the bugger took forever to charge, and it was nearly empty out of the box, so that says something. I've got brightness on the screen almost to max, Word, Excel, Firefox, and Chrome open, as well as the usual background mess of integrations, bluetooth and wifi on etc, and it's estimating 9 hours. I'm inclined to believe it. If I can get through my entire workday (I literally do not leave the computer, I work a solid 10-12 hours a go), that will be a commendable record.It's extremely snappy. Loading tabs on browsing, loading complicated spreadsheets with scripts and scrolling pages, it all works fine. Connected to my gaming PC and streamed some Doom 2016 and Half Life 2 just to see how that would work out, and it does very well with some noticeable but acceptable lag (though I needed to switch to 5G band). Don't expect e sports over wifi, kids. Haven't tested any gaming running on the actual hardware, but I would think it's pretty garbage for any graphically intense games. Not going to be a great one for that, but that's not the purpose here. 1080p youtube and netflix runs and looks great with no tearing or other visual noise, so hard to complain there, the IGPU is doing well enough for that.There aren't a ton of ports, but what's there is good enough. Running my SteelSeries Rival 100 because I refuse to sacrifice on mouse quality. The trackpad is fine and will do well enough on something like an airplane ride, and I appreciate the ability to right click. Tried charging through the USB C port and can report that it prevented the PC from dying, though it recommended I plug in something with 10W or higher rating in order to actually charge the machine, so I may try that out. With the computer almost dead, I went to bed and the USB-C had charged it by the morning, so it certainly works when it's not drawing power. Good to know I probably won't have to depend on the proprietary charger if it goes bad or gets damaged.The inclusion of Bluetooth and Wireless makes it pretty easy to hook up plenty of externals, and my 60% mechanical bluetooth keyboard worked swimmingly. I really thought I would need it for this machine, but to be honest, if you're trying to incognito type a bunch of notes while you're on calls with clients, this keyboard is a hell of a lot quieter, and is honestly kind of incredible. There's a satisfying punch on the keys, and they seem spaced and sized well. The throw on the keys is obviously very short, but you do get the feeling you're typing and not just touching a flat surface. Feels just as good as the Macbook Pro. I'm a very large person and it's working out for me. I'm a solid 90wpm on a variety of mechanical keyboards, and my first ten runs with this thing were frankly ridiculous: I keyed in at just shy of 101. It's a great keyboard, and I think I might just have to leave the 60% for longer trips when I know I'll want to use the laptop more as a desktop than anything else. I will be adding a numerical mechanical bluetooth keypad because of my data entry needs, but this little guy will do amazingly well for the glut of emails and notes I have to take throughout a day.The screen is great. Not as good as the MacBook, but close enough for work that it doesn't mater. Off axis viewing is is true to color and you'll be able to collaborate on a screen if need be. The size takes almost full advantage, beveling is super small and looks great. I got mine in the white finish because the silver wasn't available, and I'll deal with that because it was cheaper. I don't do any sort of content creation or color work, but everything looks pretty great, almost up to snuff with my desktop monitor. No, you don't get the density of other laptop screens, but brightness is acceptable and color and contrast are great, and the 1080p panel scales well and keeps the battery life going.To be honest, it feels like a lightweight version of the MacBook Pro. The build quality isn't quite up to that snuff, but it is very solid, I'm sure it will hold up nearly as well, and I'll take the weight tradeoff since the warranty is so cheap. You don't get the same peripherals, but to be honest almost nobody actually uses all those freaking Thunderbolt ports, can we all stop pretending? The company wanted to get me into one of those, but I really don't like their ecosystem or their interface. Apple has just never been as intuitive for me as it seems to be for everyone else. Anyway, since every dollar I spend eventually comes out of my paycheck, I wanted to find something reasonable that would last through a long flight with snappy performance and wouldn't make me look like a teenager with a gaming laptop. Grabbing a Macbook of any sort was going to be another 1-2000 dollars, and the performance would have been identical.I guess that's kind of the thing here. If you need something that actually gets real work done, looks professional, is incredibly lightweight and compact, and won't need to be plugged into the wall all day, this is as good as it gets in this price point. You can spend twice as much for the exact same hardware specs and a prettier screen with that sweet Apple logo, but you'll be laughing with the extra thousand dollars you have in your pocket when some Jobs acolyte is looking for a wall charger and you've still got 30%.	2	5	2	3	6
"Where do I even start with this thing? It's so nice, literally, have your friend pick it up and watch their face. They will be amazed at how light it is. Then show them the benchmarks...and mention the battery life. This laptop has made my mind blow.Display:The display is very vibrant, even though it's nowhere close to being OLED, the blacks are very deep, and everything is very vibrant. Not sure how color accurate it is, but man it looks awesome. It's 1080p, which is totally fine, it's only 13.3"" and you only see pixels if you put your face up to the screen. The bezels are very small, which makes it seem super futuristic. It doesn't get super bright, but for me, that isn't too big of a deal. I came from a 2014 13"" MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display, and it's not quite 'Retina' quality, but that's why this gets 12 hours of battery and the Mac gets 5.Design:Personally, if I had to make the purchase again, I'd opt for the gray one. The white is very pretty, but it's less than a week old at this point and it is a little dirty already. Not a huge deal as I wipe it down when I see a smudge, but just make sure to always have handy wipes available if you want your laptop to look good. The overall look isn't gaudy, and nobody will recognize it from a distance, but man the 'gram' insignia on the lid looks classy. Like really good. The plastic bezel is okay, not my favorite, but what are you gonna do?Build Quality:The display flexes A LOT! Like you're not ready for it. However, other than that, it feels premium, yet cheap at the same time. When you take the laptop out of your bag for the first time of the day, you'll feel the cold metal, but then you start to feel that it's plastic. The Nano-Carbon Magnesium Alloy is nice, however, it can be felt as plastic, which is the carbon layer on top of the magnesium. Not a huge deal, but something you might want to watch out for.Battery:It's crazy long, crazy crazy. I unplug it at 6:45 AM and use it all day until about 4 PM and it's only at 40%. I'm so not even sure how they made it so good. It's 72 Wh, which is huge, especially for a laptop that's so small and that only has a 1080p display. Most other laptops at this price point and especially ones that are this thin and light don't even come close to the battery life of this thing.Performance:The new 8th-gen Core processors are just awesome. They have very little power draw, yet they're super powerful. My old Mac had a 4th-generation dual-core i7. This thing more than doubled the performance of that, it's incredible. The 8GB of ram gets used up quickly, so I'd recommend upgrading to 16GB by yourself, just buy another 8GB SODIMM on Amazon, and pop it in yourself.Keyboard & Trackpad:The keyboard is pretty good, a bit mushy, but personally, I prefer this. The trackpad is using Windows Precision drivers, which makes it very usable. It feels natural, not quite as good as the Mac trackpad, but honestly way better than I would have thought. LG really hit it out of the park on this keyboard/trackpad combo.Verdict:Absolutely pick up this laptop if you're a performance enthusiast and someone who wants a 2lb laptop that has enough power for the day and enough battery to let you work for more than 12 hours straight. Buy one, now. You won't regret it. I promise."	2	5	2	3	6
This was an upgrade for my wife. I initially had settled on a reconditioned XPS 13 but the more I read about the re-sellers the more it sound like a crap shot. Also, portability was the biggest factor for her so the LG Gram seemed the best fit. I added an USB fingerprint scanner for $30. I was impressed the light weight, compactness and general speed of the machine. Also, IPS screen is just brilliant. Makes me hate my work laptop (Dell E7270). LG did not pack that much bloat software on it and I only had to uninstall some unnecessary software. With machines like this around it really makes you wonder how Apple sells it's Airbooks anymore. Fashion victims?No, this is not a gaming laptop but let's be real, for gaming, you should be using a desktop.	2	5	2	3	6
This laptop is exactly what I need. I have a powerful gaming desktop and I do all the heavy stuff on it. But I need a laptop to use in the meeting and do some lightweight coding on the go. This LG gram is as light as a real notebook. I install Ubuntu on it and every thing works fine except the type-C charging port, since I didn't have a 45W power brick, this is not a big deal for me. Speaking of the battery, I use it on the work and I can even leave the charge in my house and it can still last from 9am to 6am without any problem.However, I have two small complaints:1) The palmrest is kinda loose and create some noise when press it. I fastened the two screws on the bottom and fixed it.2) The speaker is bad. Use headphone.	2	5	2	3	6
Excellent product - Lightweight, great battery. the only reason for a 4 star is I wish they had a model with more memory and larger hard drive. I'd buy that also! Otherwise, no complaints!	2	5	2	3	6
Absolutely perfect for our mobile business laptop. Quick, light, thin and error free. Quality is similar to Apple products.	2	5	2	3	6
Awesome computer. Light and fast.	2	5	2	3	6
my favorite laptop	2	5	2	3	6
Light and powerful battery. But why the 8G memory made up by 4G on board and 4G on the slot? This means you can only remove the 4G memory and add a 8G memory, only 12G for you. Why this stupid design used for this PC??	2	5	2	3	6
Having been searching for a light, powerful, beautiful, all-day-battery laptop with not just a single usb c port; it totally fits all my needs. Highly recommended.	2	5	2	3	6
"All things considered it is a very nice laptop. The build quality is good, the screen is good and the keyboard also. In general everything ""just works"" which is exactly what I wanted. I'm not sure if the claimed 22hours of battery life is possible under linux but it certainly does well over 14 because at one point I had it running for about that long thinking it was powered up and then discovering that the wall socket wasn't switched on.I bought this expecting to be forced to run Windows 10 on it - which wouldn't be terrible but was not what I wanted. To my pleased surprise when I tried to install Xubuntu 17.10 it installed flawlessly and the upgrade shortly afterwards to 18.04 was equally painless.I have kept w10 on it too to dual boot and w10 works fine too. The upgrade to the latest w10 version was also problem free."	2	5	2	3	6
"This is a sweet little machine. As a long-time Mac user, I immediately categorize this as an ""Air class machine"", and if you were considering this or a 13-inch Air, this stacks up well. (I am comparing to a 13-inch Air with 256GB SSD storage, which on the Apple site right now is $1199.)Some comparisons:1. Both have 8GB of memory and a 256 GB SSD hard drive2. This (the LG) weighs about 2 pounds, and the Air weighs about 3 pounds. So that makes the LG better for schlepping around3. The LG has a touch screen and fingerprint sensor (the power button)4. Hmmm. My LG says that it has an intel i7-8550ou cpu, which is 1.8GHz and an max turbo of 4.0 GHz. But the listing for this machine says that it's intel i5-8550ou. Huh. I was shipped a 13Z980-A.AAS7U1, which is a nicer machine, with a SRP of $1399, according to the LG website. Well, that explains why it's silver and not white.Well, okay, it's time for me to stop, since I can't tell you about the machine you're considering.But look at the actual chips being used, the capacity of the hard drive, the available screen resolutions, the ports, and touchscreen/fingerprint type features."	2	5	2	3	6
this is a good laptop for most use cases except for heavy gaming. But I will recommend the 14 inch version over this, as both have the same footprint, only 14 inch version has thinner bezels	2	5	2	3	6
Like another reviewer, I ended up with an upgraded version of the base-model you see here. So, while I ordered this one, I actually received the 13Z980-A.AAS7U1.Pros:-This is super compact, super thin, and super light.-This is great for work (especially if you commute via public transportation when every ounce counts).-Likewise, great for students with backpacks full of chemistry and calculus books (this adds very little extra weight).-The battery life is impressive (about sixteen hours).-The back-lit keyboard has three settings. It is a nice touch. (It is especially great for the student in your life who is sharing a dorm room and trying to knock-out that overnight paper!)-The matte finish makes this fairly fingerprint resistant.Neutral:-Emulates MacBook layout and ports. (Great if that is a layout you enjoy/prefer).Cons:-There are warnings that state that this computer is known to cause cancer and that the user should wash one's hands after use. Hence, this may not be the best choice for children and adolescents (who may forget to wash their hands).-Although the hinges on the screen are excellent, the screen does slightly wobble as one types.-While not rated for gaming, do know that this laptop will not perform well with games like Dragon Age II or Witcher 3. So, if you were hoping that this could be your gaming computer on the side, you might need a more a powerful laptop.All told, I was truly impressed with the overall capabilities of this laptop. It is fantastic for travel, great for spreadsheets, perfect for watching videos, and has almost ZERO bloatware (I was really pleased with that!).Highly recommended!	2	5	2	3	6
Everything is good, except I did not know this item does not have fingerprint.. (I thought all 2018 gram models have fingerprint option like Korea version)	2	5	2	3	6
I purchased this product on March 24, 2018, all is working well so far. Except that after I purchased this product, Amazon decided to reduce the price point from $1,096 to $999... That's why I give it a 3 star ratings... Other than that, this device is functioning perfectly well as of my first day of using it, today.	2	5	2	3	6
"I returned it and am waiting for refund. Everything seemed to be good at first. However, the battery description was not correct. More decisively, the laptop has ""the device may now cause harmful interferences"" on the back of the laptop with a tiny font. That was literally true. I felt them strongly and suffered from a headache and mal-digestion. This is the first time experience from a laptop, which I never worried about before. I think that LG must recall the products. I am now more sensitive to EMF(Electronic Magnetic Field) due to the experience."	2	5	2	3	6
PC laptop was shipped early, came in good shape. Everything was included as purchased. I am using it now and it performs very fast. I have only HP computers so I expected to get a good product. It came with HP Elite Premium Support; I had a question so I called the help number - as they advertised there are no phone trees and a real English speaking person answered the phone. I had no hassle with him, no need to identify myself - he just started helping me. The reason I called was because Windows 10 sometimes messes up with the initial password - which defaults to a Microsoft e-mail. I had that problem and had to restart and recover the system from the backup D: drive on the system. It restored perfectly and I was very careful in setting up the initial password to be sure that I had the correct password for the Microsoft e-mail account. Everything is fine now. The HP agent stayed with me until I knew everything was working perfectly. BTW, the price for the laptop was very good - I did a lot of checking of other sites before I purchased from Amazon.	3	7	3	8	7
Been messing with this for a few weeks now, and so far it's pretty decent for the price. I got this for my girlfriend as a cheap alternative gaming laptop since we're on a tight budget. This is no where near something like an alienware laptop for instance, but for the games we've installed its definitely serviceable. We were running Mortal Combat X on it at medium settings the game was playable but would chug at times. It feels a little cheap in terms of its construction quality and is not a rugged machine but if that doesn't bother you its very functional for the price. As well the screen is a little de-saturated and not the highest resolution, but again this is a trade off for the price. On the one we received one of the USB ports its pretty tight but otherwise works fine. Probably one of my biggest concerns for this computer is the battery. The battery life isn't very good, at all probably because the battery is tiny. If you're just using this for typing, viewing documents or maybe some web browsing with the brightness all the way down you can get 4 - 5 hours tops on this. If you're for instance playing even an easily run game on the machine with 15 - 25% brightness you may get 1 - 2 hours tops.So for the price its a decent choice for what you're getting out of it. Quality isn't the word I would use to describe it, but functional with a good potential for the price.	3	9	2	8	3
After looking at pricey laptops with the same or similar specs, I bought this one. It is for my daughter, great video, super fast she loves it, and $900 less than apple.	3	9	2	8	3
Not the best laptop I have ever used. This was bought for use at the office, when working at home and when traveling for work. As a small nonprofit I was looking for something that was not to expensive but would handle daily use for Microsoft Offiice, Quickbooks, and our online data entry service. There are two issues I continually have with this laptop and that is the screen/mouse will start jumping to different screens in the middle of working on something else and the internet will drop making me reboot the computer to get it back.For the screen issue - the mouse will move around on it's own and then the screen will show all the different programs I have open, i.e. word, excel, internet, etc. It does not matter if it is 2 or 5 programs. It is really irritating when you are in the middle of typing and it switches screens. There is no rhyme or reason to when it happens.The second issue is the internet/wifi will drop or not start up. The only way to get it to start again is to restart the computer. Sometimes when traveling for work, it will not connect to the wifi at a hotel.However, for the price it is a reasonable laptop which I have been using for a year now. Next time though I will invest in something a little more reliable so that I do not waste my time dealing with these issues.	3	9	2	8	3
Even after a lot of troubleshooting and updates to programs and drivers, many issues. Slow performance (opening programs, startup, etc.), keyboard lag when typing, extremely fast battery drain, slow wireless internet connection (running 300mbps through router and can only get about 50mbps max on computer...even my cell phone was pulling 260+mbps), and Ethernet port was defective and does not work. Extremely disappointed especially for the price paid. Computer now at Lenova repair for possible repair/fix. We will see. All I know is I will never buy a Lenova again!!!! I have never written a review previously, but felt I had no option other than leave one for this product.	3	9	2	8	3
I bought this laptop for school. I am currently a Computer Science major, and this computer has been able to handle the code that I have thrown at it so far. (JS, node.JS, Python, php, and SQL). It's substantially lighter than my last computer, and smaller which is awesome. Enough storage for my needs. I've not tested any games on here, as I don't want to tempt myself to play games when I should be studying or working, but I would guess that it would hold up to a decent standard. All in all, its awesome, and I'd get it again.	3	9	2	8	3
Do not buy this laptop. I am surprised Amazon is still selling this brick. It does not start-up. I called Lenovo and they just said return it to sender. It has hardware issues. It may be missing the windows 10 program.	3	9	2	8	3
Wow this thing is quick. It runs my heavy programs with ease. No more bogging down in my 3D design or video editing.	3	9	2	8	3
"This laptop worked great at first but slowly degraded over time. If you close the screen, there is no clearance between the screen and the keyboard; this creates marks on the screen that cannot be removed. The computer is also prone to randomly shutting down which makes it heavily inconvenient for nearly any prolonged use; at first I thought it was related to overheating when I gamed on it, but even using Chrome has caused the computer to shutdown after a few minutes of use. The computer also has issues with running multiple programs at once and will freeze, which is unexpected since it's a quad-core. Of course, this all started happening after I installed new drivers for all the components though the device manager, so perhaps it's an unfair judgement that might just be an issue with a bad driver installation.Update: Installed latest drivers, installed latest bios, installed Windows 10 again. Keep getting ""thread stuck in driver"". Various people have issues with this laptop and Lenovo blamed the operating system and refused to service it in warranty unless I proved it was the hardware, but I am not a computer technician. Hardware is failing, warranty is already nearly out of date when computer arrives leaving no time to return Lenovo for repairs. Do not buy."	3	9	2	8	3
GREAT laptop--SERIOUS battery hog...so be aware of that when purchasing.	3	9	2	8	3
I cannot stream Netflix or videos on this computer without it dropping the wi-fi signal. There must be something wrong with the wi-fi card. I know the problem isn’t with my internet service-I bought a Roku and that streams just fine. I bought this laptop when it when it first got listed on Amazon. I wish I had waited to see any reviews listed before buying it. Based on what customers are saying about it, I would not purchase it now.	3	9	2	8	3
Just got it. Having a Windows start-up issue trying to start-up. The laptop is having a major issue. I'll get to a point to the initial configuration, and pointer locks up. I must then hard reboot by taking the battery out. May have to return.	3	9	2	8	3
Lenovo Quad-Core AMD FX-7500 APU up to 3.30 GHz, 16GB DDR3, 1TB HDD, AMD Radeon R7, DVDRW, WLAN, Bluetooth, Windows 10Ever since I bought the laptop, it was very slow. I hardly had anything installed in it. Bought it for my grade school kids. They uses google drive to save everything. Kids have kept complaining about how slow the laptop was, but I ignored them. A week ago, I used the laptop to go online and noticed it was slow. I tried using different sites, installed chrome, Firefox and IE. They were all showed performance. I took the laptop to a reputable service center. They diagnosed it and found out that the hard drive came with the laptop was terrible and not functioning property I had to replace the hard drive and get much smaller HD with 250GB. It cost me $230 in total. If I had known this when I bought it, I would have never bought this form this Seller: Sold by: U-DIGi.	3	9	2	8	3
So far no issues. Runs quick with no sales ware pre loaded on it.	3	9	2	8	3
Awesome laptop for the price!! Fast, long battery life, everything loaded up fast, & it came with no preloaded junk! A+++ Great buy!!	3	9	2	8	3
Love it!!!! It has the same features as some of the others I was looking at. Some additional features for less money. I like Lenovo products. Image is great and shipping was fast. Definitely would buy again.	3	9	2	8	3
"BUYER BEWARE. Thought this was a smoking hot deal in August 2017, less than 8 months ago. Then the Laptop stopped working under battery power. Battery fine, not a memory issue as this was as simple a unplugging the charger, all functions stop working, reboot, plug it in it works fine. When I started down this rabbit hole, I discovered that Lenovo does not warranty items manufactured over 8 years ago. I look for the manufacture date, it is DECEMBER 2005, my ""NEW"" laptop was built 12 years ago. The Seller is no longer on Amazon, Amazon says not my problem, same for LENOVO. Listing clearly stated new, but I guess I'm stupid. When I buy another laptop that works, it will be at BEST BUY."	3	9	2	8	3
"Really fast machine, the only problem I had is the continuos ""oh-no"" message from chrome"	3	9	2	8	3
This computer is better than I thought it was going to be. It's lighting quick easy to maneuver around on it. Tons of extras. Definitely a great buy.	3	9	2	8	3
"Not very significant for gaming. Can handle skyrim: special edition on medium graphics while being slightly choppy at the beginning. The rest is fine, like 25 fps and higher while outside. It looks slick at least, very casual. A ""chrome"" trimming around the mouse pad (I think it's just foil). A definite upgrade from my G50 - 45 amd A8 with 8 gigs of ram (came with 4)"	3	9	2	8	3
The laptop was completely dead on arrival. As soon as I started it up, it immediately blue screened. When I took it in to be looked at, no matter what component parts were switched in, it would not work, suggesting a motherboard malfunction. Do not buy this laptop. It is far wiser to spend a couple hundred extra dollars and get something that works.	3	9	2	8	3
Do not buy this junky laptop. Slowest laptop I have ever used no after a month of using it the battery will not last longer then a half hour so it must stay plugged in. Constantly freezes up while in use and unreliable. Now I have to pay for the good one should have just bought the good one up front live and learn the seller will not honor my request for return. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this computer	3	9	2	8	3
I got this for my dad and he has been using it for a few months now without issues. Runs good and was very easy to set up for him.	3	9	2	8	3
great laptop and does we need it to do - some spreadsheets, word and cruise the net - perfect	3	9	2	8	3
It meets my needs but it is slow and I had some trouble with excel crashing on it. However it is able to run an android emulator	3	9	2	8	3
This is a great Laptop. The AMD FX is an awesome processor. I ordered 5 of these for our office and they all work great. They fire up fast. They run any application that I've used so far with ease. The only downside to this laptop is the slow WiFi card. It is definitely under powered for this machine. We have 150 Mbps WiFi capabilities in our offices. These laptops can't seem to clear 54 Mbps speeds over WiFi.	3	9	2	8	3
Laptop does not boot up. Fresh out the box. It will power on, but locks up at the Lenovo screen prompt. Such a shame because Lenovo's are usually extremely reliable. But I suspect that this third party seller is either tampering with the units or they purchased a big batch of possibly defective units and are selling them. Avoid	3	9	2	8	3
Great for surfing the net, but wish it would connect to the faster 5.0 WiFi band.	3	9	2	8	3
The computer I owned before this one was a Lenovo and I really liked it because it lasted about 7-8 years but this computer must be a stripped down version of what I had because it is about as fast as my 8 year old computer. If I had known it would be this slow, I would have spent some extra money on a better computer. Just thought I would warn the next person.	3	9	2	8	3
AWESOME laptop, best laptop I have ever bought, especially for the price	3	9	2	8	3
$420.00 - bought on August 21st 2017, on Jan 3rd 2018 it died. Bought the old Lenovo Thinkpad in 2010, still going. VERY unhappy.	3	9	2	8	3
Works well, but doesn't come with word, so get ready to drop $150	3	9	2	8	3
So far so good! The mouse pad location is kind of annoying, but other than that it's all good!	3	9	2	8	3
I guess I got the lemon. After initial start up it stopped working (AC & battery). Would not restart and had to be returned (on my dime). Also I noted the product was made in early 2016 I thought it was a 2017 version.	3	9	2	8	3
The performance of this laptop was very good. However, within 4 months the hard drive shut down. We are in the process of returning it to be fixed since it is still under a one year warranties.	3	9	2	8	3
OUTSTANDING,this computer is beast...the processer in this laptop is shocking powerful...the Wi-Fi range is over 100ft inside to outside the house...I am seriously thinking about buying another one for work.....I have had 5 other computers and none are even close to this laptops power....	3	9	2	8	3
so far so good after 1 month!	3	9	2	8	3
This laptop is pretty good. I can play my games with high graphics. The only thing that I found wrong was the audio system. It's a bit distorted and the mic makes me sound demonic. The sound system was a 2014 version. Other than the bad sound this laptop is pretty good. It has everything just as described. I'm just hoping no one else has this audio issue like I am having.	3	9	2	8	3
I put off buying a new laptop for years and instead used an HP Notebook, which is primarily for checking email and watching Netflix. I had to upgrade though, because I needed to do more than just the basics of email and watching shows online. Several people I know use Lenovo for their businesses and after researching the specs I wanted, I decided to go with it. I've had it for a month and it works great. The only personal adjustment I had to make was the sound as this one is Dolby and the HP was DTS Studio (which was better), but other than that, I have no complaints. The AMD works just as well as Intel and I am actually able to save files on the Desktop without the HP Notebook telling me storage is less than 500mb. I do however, recommend iCloud or Google Drive as it is a good backup in the event anything happens to the laptop. This Lenovo is fast, quiet (even after hours of working online), sleek, light (compared to other laptops), and durable. Just watch out for the right Shift button as it's smaller than the one on the left. I've repeatedly hit Enter when I didn't mean to.	3	9	2	8	3
I really love this computer. The only reason it didn't get five stars is because the screen is smaller than I was used to. A great laptop, however!	3	9	2	8	3
Great for gaming	3	9	2	8	3
Works beautifully! I love it! Does everything I wanted and needed it for. Great machine, great price, great transaction.	3	9	2	8	3
mouse doesn't function well	3	9	2	8	3
This computer came with all the bells and whistles it specified including the 16 gb of ram. CAN'T beat the price for everything under the hood on this one.	3	9	2	8	3
"This is a very short, initial impression review. If my opinion changes, I'll update or write a separate review. I am on the fence about this laptop...I HATE the keyboard. I have missed strokes in every single sentence. You have to put an incredible amount of pressure on the keys to register a stroke, and the keys that are struck with the pinkies are especially difficult to get a good hit. It actually feels like I am typing on one of the old manual typewriters, if anyone remembers those. I have to go back and retype sentences constantly because of the missing letters. Occasionally, I will have double strikes with the same letter being typed twice.Another thing that irritated me about this laptop was the length of time it took to load up. It is expected for a brand new laptop to have updates available - it probably sat in a box in a warehouse for months, so updates have been released since it was manufactured. But, it literally took 90 minutes for this thing to download and install all of the updates. It was quite annoying.The battery is lackluster at best. It will last around 3 hours, which I suppose is not bad, but I was hoping for more. I suppose I could get a larger cell battery.Check your warranty online. Go to the Lenovo website and register your machine. I did, and it said that the warranty had been initiated in January of 2017, which is puzzling, because I just received it on 03 September 2017. I did an online chat with a customer service specialist and was told that ""this happens all the time.""Perhaps the most irritating thing about this laptop, even more irritating than the keyboard that I HATE, is the connectivity to WiFi. I do not have cable, so I watch movies and videos on my smart TV. I also have my cell phone connected to my WiFi while I'm home. Neither of those devices ever drop the WiFi signal, but this laptop does. Constantly. If I put the laptop in sleep mode...or even if I just don't touch it for a while, it will disconnect. When I try to get back on the computer, I have to manually connect to WiFi. Half the time, literally, it will not connect. It will show that there is no internet access. So, I will have to go into the settings and ""forget"" my router, then re-register it, entering the password again. I've done this MULTIPLE times since I received the laptop on Sunday. Today, no matter what I did, it simply would not connect. So, I had to unplug my router and allow it to fully reset. The computer finally connected at that point, but it shouldn't have taken that because both my phone and TV were connected and functioning the entire time.One last note......this review began with a 3-star rating, but the more I cataloged the problems I am having, and the more I had to type on this DREADFUL keyboard, the more irritated I got. So, it's now a 2-star rating.Find a better laptop."	3	9	2	8	3
I am a gamer and this is NO gaming machine. I increased the turbo to the max 3.3 and FRPS maxed at 16, stutter, freezing, skipped scenes. This is not a gaming system at all. If you are looking for an inexpensive gaming laptop, this is not it. I purchased this as a more portable laptop than my ASUS w/ 64G Ram that weights 12 lbs and what a regrettable decision. My MacBook gets better FRPS than this machine does and it's 4 years old. The graphics card is junk and the screen is pixelated with outlined and bright around avatars and terrains. Do yourself a favor and save a little more cash and purchase a computer worth your hard earned money. The plastic casing and small fan also makes the fan run non-stop at running barely any low level game such as MineCraft, for example. I give this a - - - star actually as it took almost a whole minute to even open up a word document. Returning after trying to increase capabilities with no avail. Those leaving high end reviews, must never have had a decent laptop if they think this is actually a gaming machine.	3	9	2	8	3
"I love, love, LOVE this laptop! Been using nearly every day for a couple months now. It's honestly been the best laptop I've ever owned and I've had several ""high end"" laptops in the past that had all kinds of bugs and wonky problems that couldn't be fixed or worked around. This, laptop, though, has out-performed even my best CPU's in functionality, power, and speed! I love that the laptop is VERY quick to start up.. No waiting 10 minutes for it to boot up - more like a minute and a half. Likewise, Windows homescreen is loaded within two minutes or less of signing in... my past laptops took at least five minutes - usually more - to get everything loaded so that I could actually use it. With this laptop, I can shut it and when I open it again, it pulls out of sleep mode instantly! My past laptops would just stay frozen in a sleep state if I ever closed the laptop while it was active/in use... which really sucked considering I have three kids under five that LOVE to shut my laptop when they walk by. Everything about the laptop is fast, really. It doesn't really get hot or overheated, which was another big problem I've had with past laptops... In fact, it's never even gotten warm enough on my lap for me to want to set it on a table or elsewhere from discomfort. It is extremely quiet and I really don't hear it running unless there is a CD/DVD in and the optical drive is in motion.The ONLY thing I have noticed that may potentially be a drawback is something that might not even be the laptop's fault. On multiple occasions, I've found that after 9 or 10PM the internet would suddenly stop working. I could see all kinds of wifi networks but it would always just say ""unable to connect"" to any of them regardless of right password and other devices working just fine on the same wifi network... However, I recently went into my settings and chose to more or less 'reset to default' my network settings and since then, haven't had a single problem. So, I wouldn't even consider that a notch against, considering that resetting that one thing has worked just fine... it was probably just a very random error that, clearly, was easily able to be fixed without any sort of outside help or costly service/repair fees. =)I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is a student, does office-type work from home, or just the occasional light user. I have not tried playing video games or anything of that sort (apart from old DOS/NES games you can find to play online), so I can't really say how well it would do for a gamer."	3	9	2	8	3
Bought this in July 2017. Motherboard broke in about 9 months, laptop is completely dead. Manufacture's warranty already expired because its an older product. Watch out for duds.	3	9	2	8	3
"Great for budget gaming. Runs Gta 5 on medium settings and Skyrim on high settings. It was listed as used but id be surprised if it was even ""used"" for an unboxing video."	3	9	2	8	3
Froze up constantly after the 1st day, sending back.	3	9	2	8	3
It's not as fast as it's expected to be, but it's ok. Thank you!	3	9	2	8	3
Runs WOW nice 50 to 60 fps drops some in raids. Very nice for the money	3	9	2	8	3
Not as fast processir as I expected but still good overall.	3	9	2	8	3
Great for the price. Fairly fast and supports 2 external monitors allowing 3 independent screen views. Definitely will recommend for a home office or a student setup.	3	9	2	8	3
my kid needed a laptop that plays minecraft and some other games and it has exceeded our expectations. Very nice laptop for the money	3	9	2	8	3
It really has 16gb of ram. Can run Star Wars: The Old Republic on high settings without any problem. Highly recommended and worth its price.	3	9	2	8	3
Great met all my needs.	3	9	2	8	3
Is a nice powerful computer just what I need and super easy to set up	3	9	2	8	3
Great laptop. Not a single issue. Upgraded wifi card cost $30ish otherwise havent changed a thing.	3	9	2	8	3
For a computer that is supposed to have 16 gb of ram this thing lags and all my programs freeze up one at a time randomly and I have to task manage them to shut it down and reopen it. Very poor product. Technical support not much better. there was a problem with the numbers pad it kept acting like the mouse. and tech help could do nothing to solve the problem. I finally figured it out my self while waiting ten minutes for the girl in the Philippines to ask how to solve the mystery when all it was is a easy access setting found in the control panel. so frustrated my mom bought one and no issues I decide to take the leap to Lenovo and now I regret it. Also my warranty was out dated the same day I bought it I had to send proof of purchase and Lenovo still has not replied to let me know if the warranty has been updated yet.	3	9	2	8	3
Very good upgrade for my older HP laptops.	3	9	2	8	3
Love the computer, but the mic is horrible and every mic I plug in sounds terrible	3	9	2	8	3
Great starter computer	3	9	2	8	3
I would not recommend this product. The computer works fine, however, the track pad goes wild often.	3	9	2	8	3
So far so good. It came as expected. Don't like that it shows fingerprints as much as it does, and the keyboard is a bit low profile for my taste, but really, that's the worst I have to say about it. The specs are awesome for a laptop for this price. I will update as I have more information. We are ordering another one though.	3	9	2	8	3
I did my research and took expert recommendations and I loathe this machine. It's glitchy and slow. The keyboard isn't responsive (or my typing is somehow different on this machine than all others). It's too late for a return, but I want to be sure to warn others. I've tried looking online for help and cleared out the start menu. There was a small improvement, but not enough. Buyer beware.I'm following up with Lenovo support and they are going to perform a system reset, but cannot refund my money since it was an Amazon purchase (which is fair). The Amazon windows for returns and/or product support has closed. I may end up with the world's most expensive photo album.	3	9	2	8	3
Great comp som loves it	3	9	2	8	3
I have had mine for a little over 4 months and love it. I play World of Warcraft on it no problem. No problems with sound. The only time I see lag is on 40 man raids. I use for evrry day work and it works like a charm. And great price.	3	9	2	8	3
warped new out of box....	3	9	2	8	3
"Not impressed with this product. I bought this laptop to replace my old HP desk top with Windows Vista operating system. I was sure my old PC was ready to crash. It was moving very slow, and would ""freeze up"" frequently. I expected the new laptop to move quickly and smoothly through tasks. However, it has been as slow as my 15 year old PC. It locks up/freezes up frequently, requiring a hard reboot to get going again. This is very frustrating and happens whether working on or offline, so it's not my internet connection. I also do not like the keyboard."	3	9	2	8	3
This is a great product,with great specs at a great price point!	3	9	2	8	3
I love this computer. The keyboard action is excellent. The speed is top notch. It came with a DVDRW which was not in the ad and is a great added bonus. Don't need and HP or Mac when you can get this nice of a computer for 2/3 the cost.	3	9	2	8	3
I bought this laptop to use while my HP desktop is in the shop,-- it doesn't work with Verizon FIOS. This laptop works great with it! No dropping the signal, no unnecessary third-party software. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would buy it again.	3	9	2	8	3
Great laptop! Plenty of memory, loads pages quickly and was easy to set up and add my printer. Planned to buy a tower with monitor and keyboard, but this fits my needs much better. Light weight and has a DVD player too.	3	9	2	8	3
I like the computer, but the battery life on it is not as described. It doesn't last long at all and I constantly recharge it. For example, I charged to 100% and less than an hour later it was already at 56%. I'm thinking the battery is defective and was instructed from the seller to contact Lenovo directly. Other than that the laptop works well. I probably don't use it to its full potential as I am just using it for school. I gave it three stars because of the battery.	3	9	2	8	3
Easy set up right out of the box. No problems with connecting to internet. I had a few programs, that I use for my business, that were easy to install from each website once logged in. I spent more time customizing my settings the way I'm used to than anything but now all great. As to specs, I can't necessarily comment because as long as it works, I'm good.:) I use this for business so was looking for the best value with most capacity, etc. I'm not a gamer. Thus far, seems to run efficiently and smoothly. Will update if any problems.	3	9	2	8	3
Listed as a 3.3 GHz processor but only 2.1GHz when I pull up system info. The ram is 16 but DDR3 and not DDR4 but still good performance. Its very sleek and a good size for a laptop.	3	9	2	8	3
The Pros: It comes well-packaged. Setup is easy, though it takes time It seems to be made of good materialsThe Cons: It ran abysmally slow until I went into settings and manually had Windows 10 index all the files The keyboard layout could be better, with better placement of the arrow keys The keyboard is of poor quality. I'm a touch typist, and sometimes I have to hit a key twice to get it to register The function keys are poorly labeled Even after indexing, it seems to run slower than I would expect of a gaming laptop The screen resolution should be higher for the price	3	9	2	8	3
The photo happens to me every time, I think it is the processor but I really do not know. In the photo it leaves as the screen remains	3	9	2	8	3
Beautiful laptop with amazing specs. Two of the small details that really help set this laptop apart from others are that the keyboard is very quiet while typing and that it's Signature Edition. Knowing that this laptop came out of the box with no junkware or 3rd party trialware, already bogging it down, was such a relief. Ended up being very quick, and painless getting the laptop set up with all of my preferences.	3	9	2	8	3
keeps crashing saying thread stuck in driver did this at the beginning when I received it then it's been doing it much more often the longer I have it other than that for the price not to bad eats the battery fast like within 10 minutes of just checking email. Wouldn't recommend buying	3	9	2	8	3
Sent it back. The computer was not what it was advertised to be.	3	9	2	8	3
Everything we needed for our buisness	3	9	2	8	3
Touchpad is defective. Cursor jumps around, clicks on icons. Don't recommend using.	3	9	2	8	3
It doesn't start up ... don't buy this	3	9	2	8	3
So far it is good	3	9	2	8	3
I purchased this computer end of February. Very happy with the appearance and size. I admit I haven't used it much because I have another Lenovo laptop I use for work that I use the most. I purchased this one because I needed a personal computer, BUT it is so incredibly slow it's almost impossible to use. It takes forever to load start screen then once that's open im lucky if i can get the browser up. I'm very disappointed since he has more features than my other Lenovo that is 2 years old and has alot of docs and programs stored on it. I have nothing stored on the new one and im ready to throw it out the window. I cant even imagine trying to play a game on it as advertised! I only wish I would have tried using it when I first bought it because I would have returned it the first week of dealing with this!	3	9	2	8	3
Please, do not order this computer. I ordered one and within a few days it started freezing up sporadically. I returned it and got a new one. About 5 months later, this laptop now has a failed charging circuit on the motherboard rendering it totally useless. I now have to replace the motherboard in order to use this. This is within 5 months of ordering a new laptop! I cannot return it any longer and I did not get a warranty, I suppose it's too much to ask to have a new computer work for longer than 5 months.DO NOT ORDER THIS!	3	9	2	8	3
Good laptop for the price.I dont like the mouse pad, but its ok for me.	3	9	2	8	3
The product is very good and the service was excellent.	3	9	2	8	3
0 (ZERO) stars. Nothing but the Blue Screen of Death from I powered it on. Serious harddrive problems. Seeking a refund. DO NOT PURCHASE	3	9	2	8	3
Had faulty drives upon the initial boot. Blue screen of death. Basically got a bugged system. Not cool.	3	9	2	8	3
What a flop! I bought this for my daughter for Christmas since she decided to go back to college. I bought this in November, gave it to her on Christmas, and the monitor was dead by January. Reached out to Lenovo to get warranty work done as this laptop comes with a 1 year warranty only to have the service tickets cancelled without notice.The computer and the customer service both STINK!	3	9	2	8	3
This laptop is just terrible i've literally had it for only 3 days and i have so much to say about first off the laptop randomly freezes a lot second the sound quality is TERRIBLE i tired updating the drivers but it still sucks the headphone jacks quality is even worse it makes my 300$ headphones sound like i bought them at dollar tree and now just a few minutes ago im getting this really small but noticeable glitch line across the top of my screen. I wouldn't recommend this laptop to anyone the price is too high for the crap that i got ill definitely be returning this trash	3	9	2	8	3
Love it.	3	9	2	8	3
Received the laptop checked everything on it so far it is great just a reminder you must have knowledge about computers it has a few things you have to go thru and update and sign on if your DVD player is not working and it keeps telling you to go to app store down load Kodi from app store then your dvd will play or find a tech geek to help you. Because it only comes with standard apps but it's a great laptop.	3	9	2	8	3
This laptop is an excellent machine for gaming, I just have bought more when it was at the lower price.	3	9	2	8	3
When I first power on the computer, it's ALREADY LOCKED with ANOTHER USER, PLUS IT ASKS FOR YOUR LOCATION. Have to return the laptop asap.Beware of this product ! ! !	3	9	2	8	3
I ordered mine refurbished (Like-New) and might I say im quite impressed. Fast, no bloatware and beautiful sleek design. Only thing I didn't like was the ups gal leaves my package on the porch. Thank god I was pulling in as she were pulling out... That totally came out wrong. Ill update	3	9	2	8	3
"Very disappointed with this product. This is supposed to be a new, signature addition laptop, but I have had nothing but trouble with it. I have the highest McAfee protection on it, I run multiple scans, and I don't download anything funky. There is no excuse for this why this shouldn't be top notch! It is so slow and it constantly lags...not happy. I have the highest internet that Cox Communications provides and I'm STILL getting a ""not responding"" message at the top of my search engine."	3	9	2	8	3
Lenovo is a reliable product but the laptop I received would not boot up. Called technical support walked me through a set up but computer crashed. Returning product	3	9	2	8	3
Couldn't even use this for more than 10 minutes. It started crashing and was always showing BSOD. The novo button was't working at all. Spent over 40 minutes on the phone with Lenovo Support yet nothing could get this crap laptop working fine. I have to return it. This is a second bitter experience with Lenovo after their Y700 turned out to also be a useless laptop for me in 1 week. I am done please.	3	9	2	8	3
No complaints at all, sure wish I would have bought one earlier. Easy to use, great quality.	3	9	2	8	3
Its Pretty good laptop but the battery suck..5hrs my ass more like 2 and less if you have your screen brightness youll see maybe an hour ...out side of that i would recommend it i can run protools /Vdj other studio programs with no lag.adobe Premier Pro Runs pretty good as well.	3	9	2	8	3
was exactly what i expected.	3	9	2	8	3
I love this laptop. It is really nice and everything I expected it to be. I haven't had any problems with it thus far and I am thinking about getting another one for my son.	3	9	2	8	3
I am trying to get rid of mine already. This thing is slower than a snail in molasses going uphill against the wind.I REGRET BUYING THIS PILE OF JUNK!!!Been using Lenovo now for a while - this one is NOT a winner by any means...even at this price-point.	3	9	2	8	3
"Bought two of these for my teenage daughters for Christmas. They LOVE them! I did purchase an extra 1TB hard drive (also from Amazon of course) for each since they only come with 128GB SSD. They boot up in 10 seconds with the solid state drive which is why I purchased them. I see no reason to pay more for a larger SSD when I can easily add a 1TB drive for $50.I do wish Dell would follow other manufacturers and add a simple compartment on the bottom for upgrading the hard drive and RAM. Instead they cover one screw with the service tag requiring you to pierce it to take the bottom off. I find that to be a horrible business practice. Hey Dell, the 90's are over and people want to upgrade their laptops themselves without paying some overpriced ""service tech"". I guess the threat is that it will void the warranty. Well not in my state.And they wonder why they're losing market share.But even with that terrible corporate Big Brother mentality, it's not worth knocking off a whole star for it."	3	4	3	2	6
Really fast little laptop! Thanks to the SSD!	3	4	3	2	6
This computer has had issues since the day I bought it. The technical support is with techs whom I can barely understand. They want me to send it to them and it could take 5-12 business days. I will never buy another Dell computer.	3	4	3	2	6
Excelente producto. Recomendado.	3	4	3	2	6
In my opinion this is a great laptop. Did a lot of research and a lot of people complained that it ran very slow.There was A LOT of bloatware on this laptop. Delete all dell applications, and anything else you might not use it for. Took about 30 minutes and now this things is firing on all cylinders! Great for what I needed it for	3	9	3	9	6
Seems like a great unit have always liked Dell. The power plug is smaller than my older units, but I expect great durability. Bought this to replace my work laptop which died after 5 years of abuse! This is my third Dell I expect it last just as long. Has touch screen which doesn't seem to sensitive, the whole thing is very lite and has mosterous storage capacity. 2 freaking Terabytes! I've already had it grinding away for a few hours transfer a couple hundred gigs of data! The other reviews say its slow I have not noticed that, but DELL did install alot of crap that I don't use mostly antivirus and support programs. Great laptop at a great price !	3	9	3	9	6
Straight out of the box looks nice great features. Runs slower than expected. Before I connected to the internet for the first time it was running slow. After I hooked it up and did all the suggested updates still muchslower than my old laptop that only had 1gb of RAM. The wireless card doesn't support 5g and is constabtly having connection issues with various routers. It would've been great to know that it had outdated hardware before purchasing.	3	9	3	9	6
"It is built very flimsy.The evident build quality is obviously poor.Like other reviewers noted, it comes loaded with all kinds of bloatware, and with an old version of Windows 10.It took about a day of downloading Windows 10 updates before I was even allowed to see the system and hard drive, in order to verify it was the computer I ordered. Then there was another day of cleaning out the Dellware. BTW, forget it if you do not connect to the internet by cable. The WiFi Windows 10 update did not work at all.I suppose if the cost of the computer is cheaper due to the bloatware, you could make arguments that it is OK. But if you want to just buy a computer and use it right away, don't get this thing.For instance, it comes with McAfee antivirus. It only took two days before I was getting pop ups for an expensive monthly subscription to McAfee, or ""be unprotected"". It took me quite a while to figure out how to remove McAfee and start up the free Windows Defender.Even after a lot of effort on my part, the computer is still infected with Dell software, and I expect I will never quite delete all of it. Little windows keep popping up asking me how I feel about Dell service, for instance. It is very difficult to know which program from Dell is needed for something essential like mouse support, and which one is basically Dell spyware.The hardware side of things is no picnic.The thing re-boots itself once or twice a day for no apparent reason, and then starts up YouTube and plays the last YouTube video I have watched. So in the middle of the night YouTube starts playing, and I have to unlock the screen in order to turn it off.After it self re-boots the touch screen feature often will not function. A re-boot will not bring back the touch screen, but so far a complete shut down and re-start will fix it.The touch screen, when it does function, feels crude.The speed of the computer is adequate for the price. And the screen viewing angle is also adequate.But the case and keyboard feel like a cheap disposable toy.Obviously, I cannot recommend this, but I am lost as to what else I might choose. From what I can see, the other manufacturers are all just as cheesy.Good luck!Update - after 3 or so weeks. The computer has been stable and works as it should. The initial setup was a grind. But it has not re-booted itself for the last 3 weeks, and the touchscreen is functioning."	3	9	3	9	6
I do not work for Dell but computers are my business. This is a very good laptop for the price. At this price do not expect a gaming machine but expect a stable computer to surf the web, email and play some videos. Other reviewers tend to think that you should be able to play the newest games on ultra high settings for about $400.00 There is a reason there are still $2000.00+ laptops out there.	3	9	3	9	6
Within three weeks of receiving the laptop, it started to go through the dell testing upon booting it up. This is over a seven hour process. When it was almost done it would freeze within the process. I would have to restart it and start all over again. If I had it longer I would send it in for repairs, but I've only had it three weeks so I'm just going to return it. Will be purchasing an Asus or Lenovo in the future.	3	9	3	9	6
Unfortunately received an older model Dell Inspiron (NOT 2018), non-touchscreen (ordered touchscreen), and only 256G SSD (ordered 2T). Hopefully this was and oversight and not intentionality sent to bait and switch a novice computer purchaser. Disappointed.	3	9	3	9	6
SLOW! I just upgraded my internet connection to gigabit service and this Dell only downloads about 40 Mbs while the Windows 10 Lenovo I have 3which is supposedly not as strong because it is two years old downloads through my Wifi at over 500 Mbs, Wired at about 700Mbs. The screen touch lags and the computer itself is over-all slow. It's a shame because Amazon Trusted logo was present when I purchased it but no longer appears on the page.	3	9	3	9	6
Complete and total waste of resources. Processing and hard drive speed are abysmally slow. Dell has refused to accept it as a Return so we have been burning time shipping it back and forth to Dell. They have sent out a tech to repair, no better. Stop offering to send Techs to fix this product. After three attempts to fix it, admit you shipped a DUD of a product and REPLACE it. For the amount of time they have invested, they would have been better off financially replacing or refunding.I had never purchased a Dell before and now know that DELL has a terrible product and terrible service.	3	9	3	9	6
this thing quit working on my son exactly 36hrs after the return/support timetable. It was delivered 12/7 but of course wasn't opened until Christmas day. So, my son has used it for all of 47 days. Of course, the pin key and owners manual are no where to be found. Would love to exchange this for a new one given the circumstances.	3	9	3	9	6
Bought this for my brother who just started college (2017), this is a good alternative to an expensive gaming or two in one laptop. It does run slow at first with updates and bloatware but once removed this is a very good deal for the amount of storage, ram etc. if you’re looking for something for gaming or anything to do with media I would suggest something else, but if you need something for writing, excel and simple computing tasks this is a great option	3	9	3	9	6
Little slower than I would have expected, but once you take the bloatware off the speed picks up considerably. The set up took 2 hours which is obnoxiously long and tell you the truth quite annoying. I usually buy ASUS products and will probably go back there for my next purchase. It is also feels cheaply made.It is ok, nothing special..	3	9	3	9	6
I was skeptical at first but this computer is amazing! I had a prior Dell Inspirion and this is replacing it. I got many good years out of that computer. This computer was slow at first but I automatically went and removed all the bloatware of it, now it is blazing fast! I love the touchscreen and size of the screen. Overall, this computer has been great! I hope it lasts as long as my last Inspirion.. Great job Dell!Update after 3 months: Can’t complain with it at all, it has run fantastic after disabling all the bloatware and windows 10 services!	3	9	3	9	6
laptop performs well. I've even used it as portable game capture machine, which from specs it should really suck at. The problem is the case and keyboard. Horrible. The pictures do not do it justice. This is the cheapest feeling laptop I've ever dealt with. Keyboard is mushy. I was excited when I ordered but immediately regretted it when the wife opened the box. Again though, it's been a solid machine otherwise. Good for anywhere you need cheap function over form. Just set your other expectations really low.	3	9	3	9	6
I had given up on PC after the Windows 8 nightmare. I’m about the fourth work day that was wasted trying to deal with that ridiculousness I left the office, went straight to a computer store, and bought a MacBook Air out of sheer rage. Never had a moment of trouble with it and swore I would never buy another PC. Recently I hired an assistant who has never used a Mac, and I didn’t want to spend Mac money, so I bought this for her. It’s been perfect so far. I’m no tech expert but I know a crappy computer when I see one, and this is not one of them. I was using iCloud but needed to switch to OneDrive because I don’t want my assistant in my personal photos, etc. Now I’m planning to buy a second one for myself since the MacBook Air makes it hard for me to use OneDrive. It’s cool that it has a touch screen too. I didn’t think I would care about that but it’s handy every once in a while.	3	9	3	9	6
After the nightmare of going thru the many updates which bogs the machine down upon unboxing I have found this laptop to be fast, efficient and solidly built. Just be patient in the first 24hrs. and you will be rewarded with a great little laptop.	3	9	3	9	6
Less than 6 months and the Hard Drive is going bad. Dell is sending me a box to send it to them to fix. I'm a little leery about sending it but they're doing for no cost.. I scanned the QR code and it said HD failure. I checked the description from Amazon-it's not matching what Tech is saying.. I hope Dell will bring this machine to the specifications that I bought. It only failed long after Amazon could intervene.	3	9	3	9	6
I can say that I become a little bit disappointed when started using the notebook. I really thought that an I5 with 8Gb would be much faster. Maybe Windows 10 demand a lot of memory. Was necessary google for some tutorial that could help me to how to optimize the configuration. Add some more memory would be the second alternative but it would cost some money that is not available at this moment.	3	9	3	9	6
"Sometimes I have to press the number key twice.... not sure if it's the laptop just being slow..... or the key pad needs to be more sensitive....Or is this computer really new or ""not with pre installed malware"" recording what I type........ When it decides to act right, it's ok for light use."	3	9	3	9	6
Excellent. Coordinated well with iPhones.	3	9	3	9	6
It’s a dell and so far it’s been good but the track pad acts a bit weird at times and gets a bit un responsive. It will probably get fixed with a update.	3	9	3	9	6
Everything works on this Windows-10 laptop- I just wish that Dell had included a 'disk-busy' LED to see when the PC is 'working'.. Other than that I'm very pleased with the touchscreen laptop's operation.	3	9	3	9	6
Seems a little slow, I read a review that said it's processor was fast, but right outa the box it seemed sluggish.	3	9	3	9	6
"I am not sure how many star rating to give... My take on the product is, it has a good configuration and the pics look very good. The actual product is not as good looking, the plastic used is very cheap and looks very fragile. Keypad is not handy and in my case few keys are functioning reversely like @ is actually printing "" .Overall, I am giving 3 star since Dell is reputed to give a sturdy laptop but this looks very fragile and seems like needs to be handled delicately."	3	9	3	9	6
Computer is ok. Feels cheap plastic but nice having a huge touchscreen and a large keyboard. Took over 9 hours to download initial Windows update but for basic usage it's going to be ok I hope.	3	9	3	9	6
Setup was easy. Performs well right out of the box. Would like to have known if the RAM was expandable. Nothing in the Dell or Microsoft software would tell me.	3	9	3	9	6
I liked it when it worked. It is now dead. What do I do?? This has never happened with over 25 years of owning several Dell desktops.	3	9	3	9	6
This computer was for my boyfriend and he is super happy about the size of the screen and the touchscreen capability. He works very well. I'd buy again.	3	9	3	9	6
received it on time, it runs good and after removing some bloatware it ran much faster, color and sound could be much better as the color looks washed out and sound could be louder.	3	9	3	9	6
Works pretty well, took 5 hours to update ugh!I also uninstalled a lot of things that made it slow from the beginning now it's very fast.The fan is medium noise sometimes and than very quiet.The only thing is Skype. I think this laptop dont take in light well.I may have to play with the camera settings. Because in the morning with plenty light it shows very clear to the person I'm skyping with, more detailed he says.But at night with all the lights turned off ,you can only see my face if you turn on the brightness at full power. May have to call Dell about that. Because my old laptop I could use the light from the person I'm talking to would highlight my face very well without turning up my brightnessManages to hold a charge for about 4-5 hours. Also when turned off I still save battery.Very light which is good and awesome that is has a touchscreen which I most likely won't use much because I don't want handprints on my screen. The sound is very good because the speakers is actually at the bottom, but can still hear clearly.I'll update in about two weeks to make sure this laptop works perfectly.Also I do not use this laptop for gaming. It's primarily for Skype and watching kdrama, anime,and other tv show purposes.Update: 2/9/18For a brand new laptop I had to send it to dell for repair because the Fan needed replacing. There was a cinstantvticking noise. I'm returning because I should not be sending a brand new Laptop for repairs.	3	9	3	9	6
It's ok for the storage + price and features, but living in this generation, it should be a bit better, power button should have a led light at least, but this laptop looks to numb.5 years ago I had an dell and was better than this one except this on has a touch screen and storage.	3	9	3	9	6
I've already had tons of issues with this computer, in only six months. I won't buy another Dell.	3	9	3	9	6
"My husband is not a ""tech"" type of guy but he really wanted to learn how to use a computer. We got his this laptop and he has not left it alone! He is surfing the web, sending emails and using MS Office. Thank you for making such an intuitive laptop."	3	9	3	9	6
I am happy with my Laptop! I am not having any problems getting to where I want to go!	3	9	3	9	6
Nice laptop, does everything I need it to do while away from my office.	3	9	3	9	6
Love my new computer! Works perfectly and does everything I needed it to do.	3	9	3	9	6
works great	3	9	3	9	6
Keyboard feels cheap, also there are no power lights so you don't know if it's on or off. Good speed for the average user.	3	9	3	9	6
Arrived safely. Been using it everyday with no issues. Using for audio editing as well without issue.	3	9	3	9	6
The delivery was good, but when i openned the box i realized that the power plug was not in the box, so I can't use the computer because i can't connect it to a power supply.	3	9	3	9	6
Son says it's great	3	9	3	9	6
My rating is low because the power button works intermittently. Sometimes the PC turns on and sometimes it doesn't. I tried tapping the button lightly once, twice, three times and also holding the button, nothing works all the time. I do not want a PC that turns on some of the time so I'm returning it.	3	9	3	9	6
Not as much bloatware as I assumed would be on it, it actually is a good deal and works well. Easy to set up [Cotana starts yammering upon plugging it in] and just as easy to remove all the unnecessary junk and run faster. Happy with it overall and would recommend to others.	3	9	3	9	6
Best laptop yet!!!	3	9	3	9	6
My son just go this model as a gift and after about 3 days it gave the blue screen of death it wont boot into windows so we are going to return it for another one.	3	9	3	9	6
Great value!	3	9	3	9	6
I purchased this computer in January and so far it has been great. My other laptop was 0 years old and way too slow. This one is great for what I need it for. I am very glad I found this one and purchased it.	3	9	3	9	6
mid range model with high capacity hard disk it serves my purposes in an excellent wayhighly recommended for the reasonable price	3	9	3	9	6
just what I needed	3	9	3	9	6
Finiky. Does not always connect to wifi. Other than that it is a great machine.	3	9	3	9	6
It is easy to use, light, tin and handy.	3	9	3	9	6
nice product and useful for my kids for their activities	3	9	3	9	6
I had to disabled the touch screen because neither my finger (6 ring size) and the stylus kept hitting the wrong things. If you get this computer, I recommend buying a mouse for it.	3	9	3	9	6
Very Good product. It would be amazing if it has USB 3.0 and Dual Band WIFI. It doesn't have AC band.	3	9	3	9	6
It took a day or so to get used to it, but I love it now. It's working well. I love the touch screen feature.	3	9	3	9	6
I bought the laptop 3 months ago and does not work anymore.	3	9	3	9	6

excellent product!	3	9	3	9	6

It was awesome and everything is working great till now.	3	9	3	9	6
Great but the battery run out fast	3	9	3	9	6
PLEASE PLEASE STAY AWAY.... this was hell! After a 4 days the computer stop working and I lost all of my files I finally spoke to Dell and they advised that the computer was 165 days old. Not what I would call new.	3	9	3	9	6
Great laptop!	3	9	3	9	6
Gets the job done.	3	9	3	9	6
This was a Christmas gift. And she was excited to get it.	3	9	3	9	6
Trying to get used to the touch screen and keyboard. The one thing I am just not comfortable with is the touchpad. I am going to try to cover the left/right button so my accidental finger on them does not confuse the computer. What I like most is that it supports miracast, so I can utilize the TV to help me see the information I need for trading stocks.	3	9	3	9	6
"Crashed within hours of setup. Won't load past the dell screen.Update: So, a lot of googling got my computer to load. It worked for 3 whole months, but then when I turned it on, I got a no bootable devices found error. Again to google for help; apparently this is a pretty common problem (as was the last problem - so many common problems....). So I watched the videos and red the dell help support essays (which always start with ""turn it off and on again""), and attempted the recommended fixes and became familiar with all the terms and menus and, gosh, did none of that fix the problem. So. Here we are again, but of course it's too late to return in now.... So a new hard drive is in order. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this pos."	3	9	3	9	6
"I run a small family business from home, and without a laptop, I'm dead in the water. My Toshiba has been slowly dying for the last few weeks, and is now on it's last leg. Great computer, but I needed another one, and fast. Boss just purchased a new laptop herself and suggested the Dell Inspiron. She said she ""loves it"".Dell Inspiron purchased, with expedited shipping. I was thrilled to receive it before 10am just two days after ordering. During setup, I noticed something I've never seen: extremely loud beeps (enough to get the entire household to ask what was going on), accompanied by error codes. All codes stated there is no hard drive. WTH???? It then popped up with a QR Code to scan, which took me to Dell's website. Yep. Dell themselves backed it up. ""No hard drive"". They were nice enough to offer to ship an external hard drive to me, free of any charges. That doesn't work on my end. Ever spend a lot of time on the road? Traveling with extra gear really bogs you down, and if they were sending me one to install myself that wouldn't be external? Yeah no.End result: Have spoken to Staples. Taking my old, kind of still working, laptop in this afternoon, buying another one, and calling the seller of the hunk of plastic that arrived today to come pick it up and give me a full refund. Also note, this is the first Dell I've ever purchased, and it will be the last."	3	9	3	9	6
Took two 8 hour windows 10 update and still says something went wrong with update.	3	9	3	9	6
I love it. It has plenty of memory and works well for what I need. However, it was left on the doorstep, they didn't even knock. I was disappointed with that, but otherwise, it's great!	3	9	3	9	6
HDD ran @ 100% right out of the box and the laptop runs really slow.	3	9	3	9	6
So far so good. I bought this model after my Acer's hard drive kept dying and eventually wouldn't boot. Had all the features I wanted from a DVD drive to ethernet port, 3 USB ports (2 3.0 ports), 1 HDMI port, 1 SD card slot and touch screen (no backlit keyboard). Has 8GB memory and 2T drive with more enough storage. Speed seems okay...not super, but it will do for what I use it for. Has some Dell apps on it I haven't used and probably won't. Overall it seems pretty versatile with ample connectivity and storage for the price. Can't judge reliability yet because I've only had it a couple of weeks or so, but Dell ranked reasonably on reliability by the various tech reviewers out there. So far it's working for me!	3	9	3	9	6
This was a Christmas present for my daughter. Her first laptop was a Dell she used in college. She was thrilled to get the new upgraded computer for her power point presentations and demonstrations. It’s fast enough to handle her needs	3	9	3	9	6

INSANE! This is the 21st Century, isn't it? Dell and Amazon.com should be ashamed (yes you Amazon.com) for promoting such terrible products. The laptop is fine, I mean its a computer but what annoyed me is that I had to keep checking on the thing for almost 5 hours as it updated . . .?! If the computer is new, shouldn't the operating system and necessary programmes be up to date? Consumers only experience this inconvenience after the fact and are forced to tolerate it. SHAME on Dell and SHAME on Amazon.com!!!	3	9	3	9	6
This is not an original Dell! I should have known better! VERY slow, no codes for Excel and Microsoft Word! If I didn’t already have personal information on it I would most definitely return it!!! ORDER from Dell direct do not make the same mistake I did!!!	3	9	3	9	6
A great laptop, especially it has 2TB HD, love it!	3	9	3	9	6
"One thing you should be aware of which is a general problem with Dell laptops: it is possible that after you've had it for a while, the laptop will stop registering that the power supply is connected. It will show a ""plugged in, not charging"" sign instead of ""plugged in, charging."" The main issue with this (other than the fact that the battery will not charge) is that it causes the laptop to respond by slowing everything down to the point where it's nearly unusable and definitely frustrating. (Think an in interval of several minutes between when you click something and when the action happens). When this happened to me I read all about it online in hopes of finding a solution, but apparently the solution is with the mechanical prongs that sit within the structure of the jack. What I took home from everything I read is that if this problem happens, then it pretty much means that it's time to stop using the laptop and to get a new one. Granted, for me it happened after a few years, so if you think you'll be okay with buying a new laptop after 3-4 years then this may not be an issue for you-- but I do think that this is something you should take into consideration ahead of time. I should note that the Dell laptop I had was not a $600 one, it was much pricier than that, so it wasn't a consequence of it being cheap; you might be lucky and never run into this problem, but I think you ought to be aware that this is a general problem for Dell laptops (you can look this up online and read more about it)."	3	9	3	9	6
"I have been an ASUS user for many years and there are still two in the house - my wife's 15.6"" and my old 13"". In my search I found that Dell offered more features for dollars spent. No issues right out of the box :) The setup took just a few minutes. However, the Windows 10 Home updates along with a few hardware and BIOS update took HOURS. OK ... just have some patience. Once that was done, I ran the Dell SupportAssist which took only a few minutes. The keyboard has a nice feel and is responsive. The touchpad isn't quite as sensitive as my ASUS, but more than acceptable. There were professional reviews that the touchscreen was not up to par. I find no lack of response. The fan is very quiet and unit seems to be running very cool, an issue I had with my ASUS.The case feels a bit ""plastic"" which it is of course, and has a rough texture, which if you want to skin it, you may have an issue. A nice feature is that you don't have to remove the back if you need to replace the battery. An issue with my ASUS which is one reason for a new system, - batteries lasted less than a year. Not sure what life expectancy will be here - hopefully much better. It has a fair use time of 5 hours, which with the ability to replace the battery without removing the back is a big plus if you have need to be hours without AC.It has a more than adequate HD at 2tb, and RAM at 8gb (upgradeable). The i5 7200u processor is not the fastest on the market, but at this price point is a great value. This is not a gamers system, but I understand that it can do a fair job with many games. Keep in mind that this is a NEW unit, not a refurbished. There were a lot of refurb with less features for the same dollars and more.The seller, Trivalley, has the best rating of any Dell and HP laptop sellers on Amazon. They were a few dollars more than other sellers, but their customer service before the sale was excellent. I contacted them 6-8 times via email with various questions which were all answered promptly and completely.All in all ... Super pleased with the Seller, the laptop, and Amazon.EDIT: There is an issue with warranty. The Dell SupportAssist app installed shows that the warranty expires on 12/23/1018 even though it wasn't purchased until 2/14/2018. Called Dell and they said it was an Amazon issue and to contact them to make the correction. Guess what? Amazon said it was Dell's problem. Called and Chatted (both) with Dell and they said that they would not honor the one year warranty. Reason: the warranty starts when the unit leaves the warehouse since it was on a bulk purchase. REALLY? Contacted the Amazon Seller, Trivalley and they said that they would provide the 1 year warranty. Doesn't sound like a fair deal to me, but grateful for the coverage. Dell has probably lost a future customer even though this is a very nice laptop (see review above). If there were a rating here just for Dell, I would give them a one or two.Additionally, I contacted Dell today regarding the HD being encrypted and unable to partition. Took two chats to resolve this. No help from the first other than a phone number. Called and this tech wanted my life history before helping even though he had my system information.He was a bit irritating and I told him I was going to hang-up and try later. I did a chat again. This chat tech was even willing to do a remote to help out. I didn't have the time for that - so the email route. I got all the information I needed and all is well."	3	9	3	9	6

My last laptop was a Dell that ran solidly for over eight years. I have had this one for a bit over a year and it's been problem after problem. I am looking at having to replace the screen entirely shortly-- the touchscreen started malfunctioning and making the computer unusable after about six months until I disabled it. Now the screen has started flickering and if my computer falls asleep, I have to reboot it because it wakes up with a blank white screen. On top of everything, it's run very slow from day one, fresh out of the box. It's got a great price, but keep looking. This is not a quality machine.	3	9	3	9	6
The seller lied, It was not the 2018 model, did not have the 2TB hard drive, and did not have touchscreen capabilities. As such i am returning this product.	3	9	3	9	6
I didn't buy this from Amazon but from Best Buy. First, don't buy from Dell. After tech support fails 3 times to fix problems, they slow walk replacement. This fact alone should be disqualifying.As to the machine, eliminating bloatware is not enough. Either touchpad and/or touchscreen fail, necessitating a reboot. Windows loads slowly if you're lucky. Sometimes you get the BSOD. I have owned 3 Dells, but this is the last. I see no commitment to quality and inefficient unhelpful third world tech support.Good picture and sound quality is rendered irrelevantPre Black Friday? More likely, the Nightmare Before Xmas.	3	9	3	9	6

I love the color, it's quick, and small enough to carry everywhere. It does not automatically come with chrome so I had to download that. The only thing that is bothering me is that it only came with a 28.6 GB drive, and that it doesn't have that much space left on it. The only thing I have downloaded was Chrome, and that did not take much. Other than that it is great.	3	0	0	1	5
"Within a week I began having issues with this laptop, namely its ""blackout flashes"" I will be playing my pogo game and with every mouse click it blacks out. I restart the computer and it will work properly again. A few days ago it started the blackouts and when I restarted it the blackouts continued. I then shut it down and it took several attempts to turn it back on before it actually happened.

This laptop has been really great except that I cannot update it since I can not set up administration rights on it.

Good purchase for being a refurb but I had to get it fixed within the first week of use because it wouldn't properly update which resulted the computer in restarting constantly, slowing it down and freezing. Once I got it fixed and updated, I haven't had any issues since. I'm OK with having to get it fixed being that it was a refurb and cheap enough but was more of an inconvenience.	3	0	0	1	5

It's a good all around machine for the money. Passmark rates my machine in the 69th percentile in performance for all computers they've tested. The 12 GB memory and SSD disk speeds rate especially high, around the 75th percentile. So booting and loading apps is blazing fast. I just wish I knew more about CPUs before I purchased. This uses a 7th generation I7 processor (I-7 7500U), which rates around the 50th percentile in terms of all CPUs. Quite fast for everyday use, although it rates in the bottom third of the many flavors of Core I-7 processors. But I have some spreadsheets that use computation-intensive simulations that can really benefit from a speedy CPU. I didn't know that an 8th gen Core I-5 processor like the 8250U is actually much faster for heavy computing (I figured any I-7 CPU has to be faster than any I-5 CPU...silly me). And you can get an I-5 8250U processor for only $599 in the Acer Aspire E15 model on this site. It has only 8GB RAM, but it would've been a better fit for me...120% faster spreadsheet processing versus my old laptop instead of the 50% gain this Lenovo gives me. The Passmark website (and its free downloadable software for testing your machine) is very good for learning about different processor speeds, graphics cards and disk drives. Live and learn.	3	7	4	3	1

As advertised. Been using for two months and have no complaints. We use Lenovo computers and work stations at my job and they seemed pretty reliable which prompted this purchase for my personal use. It's fast, light, huge screen, and it looks good.	3	7	4	3	1
1 month since I bought it and it doesn’t start, doesn’t charge and it’s completly dead. Go home Lenovo! -.-	3	7	4	3	1

Just over a month after purchasing it, it crashed and had to do a hard reset. I produce music and lost 4 files which took over 80 hours worth of time to create. I didn’t have a chance to back up within the 30- something days I’ve owned it...didn’t think I needed to worry about that this soon. Lenovo won’t do anything to build my trust to continue using this and it’s too late to return via amazon.	3	7	4	3	1
Excellent computer!	3	7	4	3	1
Very happy with this laptop. It's SO pretty. It was very easy to set up ad get up and running. Had MS Office and internet in minutes.I don't mind the keyboard at all. No problems there.Video and sound are great.Only reason I knock off one star is that I don't like the touch pad. It's either over sensitive or not sensitive enough. Mouse will randomly slide across screen, have to hit the left and right tabs too hard. I ordered a mouse, and I'm sure after that it will be perfect!It is simple and streamlined. Probably wouldn't recommend for anything complex at all. But if you just want a low priced machine for word processing and basic internet, it's wonderful.	3	0	0	8	5

Comes with what may be the world's largest collection of bloatware. The excessive bloatware makes navigating and simple uses of productive software a chore. We feel like a time warp happened, this Ideapad yearns to be competitive with 2010-2012 laptops. A true electronic disappointment. A great example of unreasonable return limitations for devices which take time to unearth their lack of utility.	3	0	0	8	5
I bought this for my mom since her old computer was so slow. I thought that with the larger memory and larger storage and the fact that it is NEW - that it would be fast. It is PAINFULLY SLOW. I can’t seem to find a place to ask if there is something wrong with it... I am terribly disappointed in the quality, the customer service and how slow this computer is. It also said it came with “word” but turns out it’s just the 30 day trial and now I have to buy word to add to a painfully slow computer.	3	0	0	8	5
Terrible experience. Machine froze a few times. Had to do a complete reset. Finally froze with the start button lit up. No response from any keys. Tried to return it but Amazon wanted me to prepay the shipment internationally from Chile. It would cost 10 times of what DHL charge Amazon.Will have to settle for a local repair at my cost. And how I hate windows 10. This has a very small processor, 1 ghz about third of the size of my desktopwhich is 3ghz. For windows 10 not a good idea.Too bad! It is a handsome looking machine..	3	0	0	8	5
Ordered this for my mom, whose 76, as a Mother's day present. She wanted a laptop for months, but was was to nervous to buy one herself, she broke down in tears when she opened it. It was easy to set up and get going for her. There was one little issue with Windows 10 not booting up one day, so I told/showed her to hit the F5 button to get the home screen run the anti-virus and restart it again. She hasn't had any problems with it since. Can't wait to order one for myself!!	3	0	0	8	5

I am in the process of returning my purchase due to constant irritating running noise, not sure if it's the hard drive or the cooling fan, but it's extremely annoying, especially if you like to work in a very quiet environment.

This is an impressive laptop that’s worth your consideration and represents a good value for a few reasons.This is the nicest ‘feeling’ Acer product I’ve reviewed, though I’ve reviewed two other Acer computers and an Acer monitor. This seems like a premium product. The external branding is a more muted than on a lot of ‘gaming’ laptops and this model will not look gaudy in a classroom or office environment. That’s not the case for many competitors, which look obnoxious. The red screen bezel is a muted red, more like an accent, and the only really distinction will be that sweet backlit keyboard. While you can tell this is a gaming laptop at first sight, it still looks professional.Cortana runs windows setup now right out of the box, and it’s a quick and painless process if you know your Microsoft password. It’s a fun experience to unwrap and turn this laptop on and I can see someone really being engrossed over this by a Christmas tree with unwrapped gifts nearby. Not thirty minutes after I got this, and I’ve got Office installed to type this review, and Steam is downloading GTA V for testing its real performance.The laptop has a high performance SSD hard drive, with no moving parts, leading to a perception of a very fast system because Windows and your programs will load very quickly, however, there’s only 211 gb free on the hard drive. That’s not a problem if you just delete games you aren’t using, and adding another hard drive is possible. Bear in mind that there’s no Blu-ray or DVD drive on this laptop, which is a good thing… I’d rather have the extra space (where you can install an additional hard drive). This laptop has no moving parts aside from the keys on the keyboard, making the thing feel rock solid yet light for its size. The angular body is the most comfortable laptop I’ve typed on because my wrists and the angles just seem to match comfortably as I type. The keyboard isn’t the mechanical joy of an old Thinkpad, but it’s easy to type on with the clearly lit keys, and it’s quiet to type on. As I write this review, I’m typing quickly and easily. The touchpad is quite large and I really its subtle red frame, marking its place even in a dark room. I really like the way this thing feels and looks.I found wifi performance is excellent, particularly with a modern beam forming router. I used this laptop in a building where most wifi devices run into a lot of interference with the old steel construction, but this laptop kept working quite well. I recognize this is hardware overkill for office tasks, however even though I’ve got a few other laptops, this is the one I would take to a meeting or to type a paper. The screen is gorgeous! The audio is great for a laptop and I enjoy games and movies, but at home I’ll still pair with my Bluetooth soundbar for better bass.So let’s sum up things so far: the laptop is very nice to look at, with good sound, a great screen, good keyboard, great mouse, and it’s comfortable. It’s easy to set up and will be the gift of the year on Christmas for a lot of people.The remaining matter is the raw performance. Is this thing really going to play those games well?Well, my first impression was that this laptop was a poser. Half the vents on the laptop are fake, etched in plastic, like a fake air intake on a cheap sporty car. There are two fundamental ways to cool a gaming laptop. Either you run two heat paths, metal and fans and vents, one for the GPU and one for the CPU, or you run a single one. This laptop looks like it’s the superior dual path version, and I believe Acer designed this case with the possibility of using that solution at a higher price point, but looking at the internals and the vents, it’s clear there is a single path sharing the CPU and GPU’s heat. That means heat will spike and it will accumulate faster. I’ll get back to this in a moment.The specs on this laptop are very similar to my desktop machine I built a couple of years ago. My desktop has a quad core i5 processor, slightly faster, and it has a GTX950, the equivalent last generation version of this GTX1050. (GPU numbers can be confusing, but the 9 or 10 in these numbers is the edition, think ‘year of a car’s make’ and the 50 is the model, think ‘Honda Civic’). This laptop has 4 gb of video memory to my desktop’s two, and 4 gb is great, but otherwise the two systems are very evenly matched for performance.On paper, the specs of this laptop are great for playing games. My desktop with very similar specs plays GTA V, Skyrim SE, Echo, and many other modern games with graphics settings set very high, and it does so reliably. This laptop has a slightly more modern GPU, but that generous 4gb should mean excellent performance, actually in the realm of VR games.My expectation was that the cooling system would be overwhelmed quickly, and the laptop would either need to be set to ‘medium’ settings on games, or I would see a lot of framerate problems, and my desktop, with its equivalent specs but drastically better cooling, would outshine the laptop. So to test this I ran the Unreal “Heaven 4.0” benchmark on its most extreme settings on both this laptop and my desktop, in the same room.Again I was really impressed with the screen on the laptop as I ran the benchmark. It just looks great. The laptop noticed the tough test quickly and the fans kicked in, making the laptop sound like a PS4 running hot. It topped off at about 67 degrees C (Which is about as hot as you’d want a chip to get to preserve its reliability), and my desktop topped off at about the same point. The systems had both reached their thermal limit and would not push harder, instead dropping performance, which is exactly how they are designed.My expectations of the laptop being crushed by my desktop’s performance were quickly proven wrong. The laptop was doing slightly better than the desktop, and continued to do so for most of the 26 benchmark tests. At one point, the toughest test, its framerate dropped to 9 frames per second, but on average it did a little better than the desktop. I’ve attached a screenshot of the benchmark comparison.So, the bottom line is that the cooling solution isn’t the best design, but it is adequate for the GTX1050ti, which is a smaller, more efficient GPU design. Based on how fast those fans kicked in, I think if you use this laptop for gaming you should keep it clean and use a cooling pad, but its performance was rock solid, and that was a complete surprise to me after tearing down gaming laptops for reflows, to repair heat damage, and assembling dozens of gaming computers, which has been a hobby of mine for over 20 years. The single heat path in a gaming laptop really isn’t the best but it’s working in this laptop, and that decision absolutely made it possible to sell this laptop at such a competitive price.I played two of my favorites, Typing of the Dead, and Grand Theft Auto V (on medium to high settings) and after several hours have concluded this is a wonderful experience. I’m very tempted to get a VR headset to use with this laptop, which means I have a much stronger impression of its ability to take abuse than I did before I tested it. But if you research the 1050ti for VR you will learn it's really the bare minimum for VR. Just keep that in mind.I conclusion, I love using this for non-gaming tasks, like typing, it looks and feels great, and the performance is impressive. There are compromises, and I think they are well justified by the price. This is a great buy if you don’t need the absolute top of the line.Quick Update: After reading the other reviews I decided to grab a spare laptop hard drive and try to install it. I saw that there was a bag of extra screws in the box labelled “HDD Upgrade Screws.” I removed one long screw from the base revealing a pouch style suspension for an extra hard drive, and a typical SATA cable. I unscrewed that, plugged in the hard drive, and put all the screws back. The hard drive worked just fine in Windows. So it appears these laptops do ship with everything you need to add a second hard drive.	3	6	3	3	0
"So many mixed feelings about this thing from people who say ""buy the better one"" well I DID NOT. I bought this because it fit my budget and man am I glad I did. The haters all said it wont do X or it struggles with Y, well F those haters. This thing is smooth, looks cool, and runs like a dream. I've been playing League of Legends mostly but I confirmed it would run PubG and CSgo with no issues. If you don't have the funds for a Predator and just want a laptop that CAN game this is the one. Not to mention, its a laptop that can game for under 1k."	3	6	3	3	0
I purchased this laptop for $750 which at this point in time is a great deal. It came with Nvidia 1050ti graphics card which is good for 1080p gaming. 1050 would be a little too low in graphics power. Nvidia 1060 graphics card would be better but most laptops that carry one cost closer to $1000. Once you start reaching that high in price I’d start looking into gaming PC’s because you’ll get more bang for your buck.The hard drive I received was a Intel® SSD 600p. Which is a pcie nvme type ssd hard drive. These are faster then sata based ssd hard drives which are faster then older hdd drives. Laptop starts really fast thanks to hard drive and does virus scans faster too.Battery life is good. It can supposedly go up to 8.5 hours but seems to be more like 6 hours for regular non-gaming tasks with brightness at half and WiFi on. Keep in mind if you try gaming on battery it’ll only last about an hour or so.Overall I feel like this laptop is very well balanced at this price range that doesn’t cut corners on any of the things I value in a laptop. Hard to find a better deal for a gaming laptop that can also double as something to get work done on.	3	6	3	3	0
"I am very impressed with this so far. I managed to run GTA V Online smoothly on this pc at ""normal"" graphics settings. That's pretty impressive for the price as it is a very system demanding game. Plus, it looks pretty sleek. The battery doesn't last long if it's not plugged in but it's not intended to. This pc is intended for performance which takes power. If you need something that is going to have a long battery life for hanging out online or doing homework, you'll want to choose something different. We have only had it a week so I will update with any issues that arise.Dropping this rating to 3 stars. After just under 2 months of use - the keyboard stopped working. I tried to update the driver, was up to date. Tried to reinstall the driver, that did not repair it. Then I made the mistake of just shutting it down. Well...the power button is ON THE KEYBOARD. That means, once shut down, I was unable to turn it back on. It's now being sent in for repairs.Bumping this back to 4 stars because acer repair was very fast. However, they asked that I send the pc in the original packaging, but did not send it back to me in the original packaging, so now I no longer have it should anything else go wrong."	3	6	3	3	0
"This is an excellent laptop for gaming, basic productivity, or even some coding for a Comp Sci/Technology student. It has a bright, somewhat color-accurate IPS display, a nicely spaced, back-lit keyboard with very quiet keys for typing, and of course the beasty combination of a 7th gen Core i5 processor, a GTX 1050 Ti GPU, and 8 GB of RAM to keep it all humming nicely. This is of course considered and ""entry level"" platform for a serious PC gamer, but this isn't really for a serious PC gamer is it? Just for reference I am coming from a Lenovo IdeaPad y410p with an intel i7-4700MQ processor, a GT 755M GPU and also 8 GB of RAM, and that is a really nice mid-tier gaming laptop from about 5 years back and a great machine. Though the cheaper i5 included with this machine is still outstripped, power-wise, by my 5 year old i7 (with hyper-threading) the overall build of this budget acer gaming PC absolutely destroys everything else on the Lenovo performance-wise. The newer i5 is neck and neck with the i7, but the ""budget"" GTX 1050 Ti with 4 GB of VRAM (vs. the GT755M 2 GB VRAM) and 256 GB SSD make a gigantic difference in how games load and play.Why do I call this ""Gamer Lite""? Well because this laptop really only comes with the bare minimum required for a PC gamer. You only get a 256 GB SSD, and 8 GB of RAM. The real excellent upgrade is the GTX 1050 Ti GPU, which is freakin stellar for a PC priced under $1000 USD. Basically, you get everything you need to run most AAA titles at High settings, ON A LAPTOP THAT COSTS $750 USD! 256 GB isn't gonna give you a lot of space for a huge library (obviously) but the fact that it is solid state makes it so quick. Win 10 boots in seconds. Steam opens literally instantly. Instantly! Not exaggerating. Kiss those long load times goodbye.I did a lot of research before I decided on this laptop, and there are a few reviewers (YouTube and website reviews) out there talking a lot about heat. It is true, this particular laptop doesn't have the best design for cooling, but it is totally fine for normal use. I mean if you want to run a AAA title on Ultra settings for several hours then yeah, your CPU and GPU are gonna get hot and start to degrade. But this thing isn't for that. That's what a maxed out gaming tower with 10 fans and liquid cooling is for. Go buy that if that's what you want to do. I've seen external heat tests on this thing that look totally in line with what you would want from a performance laptop. If it gets hot then that means its time to go outside and talk to people LOL.Honestly, great value for an excellent setup. Not the best. Not even by far the worst. At this price point your options are quite limited but this is really the best bang for your buck. And also, pretty nice to use just as a PC."	3	6	3	3	0
"For the money, I'm satisfied w/ my purchase. I bought it to be used as a remote work PC for software development (.NET apps) and for occasional gaming.Screen: Colors and black levels are great. Its max brightness is probably too dim for the laptop to be used outdoors, if that's important to you.Keyboard: Nice to type on. I still prefer ""full keyboard"" laptops like Alienware and old Dell laptops, but I can type quickly on this and it's comfortable enough.Heat: It's pretty much always warm, regardless of what you're doing. The upside is that's true when gaming; it doesn't get extremely hot.Weight: It doesn't feel heavy in my lap and it's well balanced. It's very easy to open and close the screen one-handed. Good build quality.Battery: OK. So long as the 1050ti GPU is off, it seems to have a ~4hour battery (of actual use). Since this is a gaming PC, I feel that's decent.Performance: Witcher 3 runs at 55-60fps consistently w/ 1600x900 and high graphics (hair works off) and looks GREAT! Titanfall 2 ""feels"" like it runs @ 60fps with 1080p and high graphics, but I haven't ran it with FRAPS to be sure. Overwatch is an unwavering 60fps at high settings.Regarding upgrades: There is an extra hard-drive access panel and an access panel for (I assume) RAM. I opened the hard-drive panel, saw there was a cable and mounting hardware for an extra drive, so I connected a 256gb SSD I had from a prior laptop. I restarted the laptop, windows 10 detected the drive, and I was able to format it in seconds. I'll probably add a second 8gb stick of ram as a future upgrade."	3	6	3	3	0
"I bought this model on Thanksgiving. It is NOT a 1050 Ti, it is just a 1050. I verified this with multiple pieces of software. It only has 640 CUDA cores and a base clock of 1354 MHz, which happens to be the specs for the GTX 1050 and NOT the GTX 1050 Ti.Acer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6"" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, AN515-51-55WL"	3	6	3	3	0
"My model is the i5-8550u + GTX 1050 model. After a week of playing around and testing various aspects of this laptop, I've come to the conclusion that while this does seem to be the best bang for the buck of convertible laptops out right now, it's really just that. Bang for buck, as opposed to best performance. I'll be evaluating this from 3 perspectives, the average laptop user [which this was not made for], the artist, and the gamer.-The Average User - 9/10 -The laptop is something else to look at. I'm not a fan of the black and red color scheme personally, but the shinny red hinges and bezel along the bottom of the laptop provide an uncommon aesthetic that while may not be the most business friendly, doesn't impose much on others either, and definitely is nice to look at from a personal setting. The aluminum chassis is very sleek looking, but is a finger print magnet. The whole device is, and I say this with caution towards the industry, ""thin and light"" enough to fit comfortably in my backpack without any real added heft. Bootup on the SSD is fast, and the whole OS maneuvering is snappy, and there's plenty of space for everything not in program files on the HDD. 8 GBs of RAM is more than enough for any everyday use scenario. The screen is more than adequate, in my opinion. It's not super bright, but bright enough to be used in a fully lit room [though outside, the sun is a bit too much for this to handle, due to gloss glare]. It has very wide viewing angles, and due to that and what seemed like more color distinction over my last device [Lenovo Flex 3], I confused it for an IPS display [apparently it's not]. Touch input is good for everyday maneuvering, being fairly accurate and fast [more on this in the Art section]. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on, with the travel distance being almost one to one with a full size keyboard [I don't remember the distance measurement], only getting squished on the right side of the keyboard, where the numpad [which I do appreciate the inclusion of] is. It has a red backlight, which is nice and bright enough, however, Acer has a 30 second timeout on the backlight, which cannot be disabled, and is very offputting and uncomfortable when using the laptop in a dark room, as I've now developed the habit of quickly hitting Ctrl before typing in order to turn on the backlight to find the homerow keys [which is doable, but more time consuming without the light staying on]. I would appreciate an Acer update to fix this, but apparently so would the rest of Acer's community. Trackpad is good, nothing to complain about, but an interesting thing worth mentioning is that it seems to have variable click sensitivity on the left and right click buttons. You can press them softly for a mushy click, or hard for a tactile one. Web browsing, typing, etc are all doable and enjoyable on this device, for the most part. Sound is not great. The speakers are advertised with Dolby Atmos, but are very underwhelming, with very little bass, and not the most enjoyable sounding treble. It's serviceable, but nothing to write home about. They also had a problem with popping slightly, but that was remedied by dropping the Realtek quality settings from 24 bit to 16 bit [no noticeable quality loss, just more consistently clear]. As a tablet (mode), the laptop is rather big and heavy at about 5 lbs, so it's not something you'd want to be standing with for a long time, but if sitting in a chair or in bed, works fine for extended use. The weight is the tradeoff you make for a dGPU. Battery life easily lasts 7 or more hours on light usage. Also worth mentioning that the laptop makes an audible beep whenever you unplug or plug it in.-The Artist - 7/10 -I have to say, I was really excited for the digital art potential of this device after my old Flex died on me, because it seemed to be the same idea, but with better internals, a bigger screen, and a numpad. However, I have to say I'm disappointed with the touchscreen performance of this laptop. I've heard that Windows Ink works great on this device, but as I did not have Ink support on my Flex, I have personal gripes with Wacom as a company so do not own a Windows Ink pen, and I use active or ""nipple"" styli to draw digitally, I am disappointed with the touch screen calibration of the device, which Windows does not allow adequate recallibration of [all you can do is adjust your pinpoint offset, not your input timing settings]. When trying to write or draw in any application that supports it [Paint, Paint.net, Medibang, Autodesk Sketchbook, etc {+my version of Photoshop does not support touch input at all}], quickly making nonlinear shapes with a stylus or your finger in a small area will often be confused for holding down your touch input and be read as an attempted right click instead of inputting the actual shape, such as how attempting to create a small set of spike or curve shapes will result in no registered input, or as a line between where you began the input and ended it. This problem cannot be fixed by Windows touch settings, but can be mitigated by touch-drawing as if you were sketching [many small lines to make a larger image, rather than continuous lines], and then smoothing the jaggedness out in a later layer. In addition, slowly trying to draw simple shapes like lines or curves will result in a shape that resembles a zig zag along the path you traced. This is a result of what seems to be lower refresh rates of touch input that seem to be present on the display, causing a smooth motion to be broken up into inaccuracies. This was not a problem in my past touch-art experiences, and is dismaying to see here. I also heard that the non-Nitro Spin 5 comes with an included Acer Ink-supported stylus, which is again, disappointing to not see here, for a higher retail price. However, since these issues can be worked around with technique adaptations, the device still gets a passing grade. You can still create art on it, and the more I do on the device, the more I adapt to it, but it's not as intuitive of an experience as I think it should be.- The Gamer - 8/10 -This is honestly not a great price to performance gaming machine, but to be fair, it's meant to be an jack of all trades, not a gaming specialty. 8 GB of RAM, while not always suitable for gaming and multitasking, was fine for anything I tested this device with, so long as I didn't leave my 30 chrome tabs open haha... Ahem. The GTX 1050, with 2 extra Gigs of VRAM dedicated to it works wonders on most things at 1080p; Medium to Max settings are enjoyable to playable on seemingly anything. The i5-8550u on the other hand... both does and doesn't work that same magic. I should say it works like a dream for the first 30-90 seconds of gaming... and then becomes a potato. The CPU is very capable, but is hindered by temperatures and Power Draw limits. It will begin a game running at the max 3.4 Ghz on all 4 cores, destroying the framerates [60+ fps] of any game I'd tried [which is admittedly not that many in one week, but they were two more demanding ones of Dark Souls 3 [many settings tested] and Final Fantasy XV [1080p average]]. However, after the aforementioned 30-90 second turbo limit, on stock settings, the CPU throttles down to about 1.1 Ghz, sometimes less, causing framerates to plummet into the unplayable territory, as if you had gone from a pseudo i7, which is what this is, to an Atom or Celeron. On these stock settings, temperatures were around 40-50 C idle, and averaged around 68-70 C under load. After using Intel XTU to undervolt -100 mV, interestingly, temperatures went up a few degrees, at 70-75 C under load, but performance increased by almost 500 Mhz, to averages of 1.4-1.5 Ghz under load. Which still isn't great, but is better, keeping games in the 30+ fps territory. However, Acer has placed a Power Draw limit on the CPU for when the GPU is active simultaneously. While on short turbo boosts, or when only putting the CPU under load, the CPU will draw about 25 W of power to reach 3.4 Ghz across all cores, stably, and at around or just below the same temps. But while the GPU is running alongside it, it will only draw a max of 10 W, which is less than the power draw it's even rated for [15 W]. This is ridiculous, because I've observed more temporary performance with no increased heat, and I haven't found a solution to it, but perhaps it's still more to do with thermals and means that the PU's could do with some thermal paste reapplication. However, I don't know Acer's warranty policy on this, so I'm avoiding it for the time being. One interesting thing to note, however, is during my FFXV test, which was ~6 hours long, performance at 1080p average settings started off in the more ""just over playable"" area of 35-45 fps, but after the laptop had been running for hours, getting uncomfortably hot to the touch all over [I was using a controller, thankfully], performance increased to about 40-55 fps on average. Still, needing to run something for hours to let the system heat up in order to get good performance isn't a valid [or really sensical] solution to an easily remediable problem. Dark Souls 3 had pretty jumpy numbers, still displaying great performance on high 1080p during turbo, but the most consistent long term playability [40-60 fps] I found was medium-high settings on 1600x900p.-Overall - 8/10 -This is far from a perfect device. It has its fair share of issues in every area, the most notable of which are cooling, keyboard lighting, and touch input, but it's made for a niche of people who need a device that can do a bit of everything. It's a good deal for the money compared to the (mostly Lenovo) competition, getting you a gaming and art capable machine with a powerful dGPU and an SSD+HDD combo, and [not offered by the non-Nitro Spin 5 models, or by many other 2-in-1s]. It gets a more-than-passing grade, but still has a lot of room for improvement in future models."	3	6	3	3	0
General Overall Review Before In Depth ReviewPros:*Powerful graphics card at a cheap price*Decent processor will get everything you need done fast*Comes with a SSD over a standard HDd*1080p resolution to watch Full HD content*Backlit keyboard to operate in the darkness*Not too heavy*Has a nice exterior design*Computer distributes heat well and fans keep it cool*Can expand hard drive storage with HDD or SSDCons:*Plastic material can make it feel cheap*Fans get loud when playing graphic intense games*Battery life is mediocre but if you use it as a gaming desktop alternative you'll keep the power plugged in*250GB storage (I won't say it's a con because of the price and the fact its a SSD which is better for gaming, if it was a 250GB HDD then I would list it as a con)I paid $699 for this laptop. And for the price I paid I'm thoroughly impressed. This computer performs like that of a $800-$1000 computer. Has enough RAM to execute all your programs, 1080p screen, a decent i5 processor and a pretty powerful graphics card for the price. Everyone always worries about needing an i7 processor for gaming but in reality if your graphics card is insufficient in this it's not then your processor won't give you any added benefit. What people don't realize is a i5 is more than sufficient in almost all cases to game if you have a good graphics card. In comparison to my i7 Lenovo there's really not much difference in performance rather the difference lies in the graphics card. About 4 years ago I paid $1100 for my Lenovo Y50 which had a NVIDIA GTX 860M and a i7 processor and I was looking for a cheap replacement for my laptop since it broke. But I was not really expecting much from the graphics card area especially at this low of a price. But surprisingly not only does it perform just as well it performs much better (new graphic card architecture and technology) for almost half the cost. At the time the 860m was a mid range graphics card for laptops. But back then the laptop version of graphics card (m) was not on par with it's desktop counterpart and in most cases only performed about 40-70% of what it's counterpart could do. But now with the new architecture and technology the laptop counterpart performs at 75-90% of it's desktop counterpart and actually is almost identical in performance since it's pretty much the same except for a few other tweaks but I digress. So the NVIDIA GTX 1050TI although a mid range chip performs so much better than mid range chips back in the day and especially for a laptop it packs a punch. Make sure when you get your laptop that it's the 1050 TI version and not just the plain 1050. The TI version packs a bit more of a punch which does make a difference. Because some people have complained and rated the computer poorly because they received a 1050 version and not the 1050TI.My only complaint is the plastic material in which it's made of vs the metal finish of my previous laptop. The plastic makes it feel cheap (well it is) but obviously it's more of an aesthetics thing than performance. And some complain about the hard drive space being insufficient. To be honest if you're using this computer for standard work the space will be more than sufficient enough for you, but if you game then it will run out fast but for the price you're paying it's quite a steal. Sure it's not a 1TB hard drive but it's a SSD which will increase the overall speed and performance of your computers load and boot times but also your games and overall SSDs are better for gaming. And there's an extra hard drive slot so you can always expand the hard drive manually either with a standard hdd if you're on a budget and need extra space or a 2.5 m sata II SSD if you want extra space with the continued faster performance. But you have to call Acer once you receive the product to get the HDD kit to add the extra storage. Aside from that the only other con is it can be loud when playing graphic heavy games but if you're alone and you have headphones on it won't bother you much. The fans although loud does keep the laptop cool despite the plastic.Overall the computer is a great purchase. Powerhouse performance for under $1000. Only difference between this laptop and others in the $1000 range is the hard drive space and sometimes the processor. As I said before the i5 processor is more than enough and you can manually add an extra HDD or SSD (just remember to call Acer to get the kit to expand storage it's free of charge) so technically there's not much difference maybe only in the material its made of.	3	6	3	3	0
Pros, Good keyboard & trackpad, decent screen, good for almost all games playing on high to meduim settings with 60 fps. Cons, thermals are good for older games but without a cooling pad it runs at 70 degrees c & could overheat when playing for a long time though I haven't had any issues. Overall this laptop is very good. I haven't played a ton of games but what I have & seen is running things like overwatch & Minecraft & some other games it runs good at high settings but starts to dull down when running at ultra but still runs well, Minecraft though runs at fully maxed settings with max draw distance with 100 fps.	3	6	3	3	0
"Excellent gaming laptop for the money but sacrifices had to be made to keep the cost down.Things I like:Sleek designRespectable Hardware and Performance (Quad-Core i5, GTX 1050Ti, SSD, matte IPS monitor)Relatively lightweightThe M.2 SSD in my laptop is actually NVME (by Intel). Surely not comparable to a Samsung 960/961 but still faster than SATA protocol.Easy to upgrade RAM and add additional 2.5"" sata HDD/SSD (fortunately my laptop came with the HDD kit included)Backlit keyboardUSB3.0 Type-CPrice (got it for $699+ 6% tax )Things I don't like:The monitor may be IPS but don't expect a high RGB coverage and it is quite dim.Only 2 USB3.0 ports (the other 2 are USB2.0)The Type-C port is not Thunderbolt compatible, which kind of defeats the purpose of a Type-C port...Even though the design is sleek and attractive, it is made of plastic which, honestly, feels kind of flimsy. The finish is indeed nice but coming from a DELL i7559 (still plastic but far more solid), this ACER doesn't make me feel very confident...The M.2 SSD is not accessible unless you remove the whole back plate of the laptop, making the replacement/upgrade unnecessarily difficult and will void the Warranty. I consider this to be a major design flaw.Battery life nowhere near the advertised one. It seems to me that a 48Wh battery just cannot provide 7-8 hours as ACER claims. My old DELL had a 74Wh battery and I was happy with its 5-6 hours of battery life.CONCLUSION:Overall I am happy with my purchase.The performance/price ratio is probably the best out there.Just don't have irrational requirements. This is a gaming-on-a-budget laptop, it's not a Premium or a niche product.It is focused where it counts for the purpose it was made (processing power for decent 1080p gaming).It was not made for ultra portability, photo editing or showing off.But it does deserve every penny..."	3	6	3	3	0
Amazing computer for the given price; there’s a coolboost system that you can turn on. If anyone plays overwatch; it runs on 70FPS with the power plugged in and roughly 50C-55C when running with coolboost on. If you’re the type to run multiple things in the background while playing games, then I would recommend a 16GB RAM. I found 8GB to be barely enough with only one application open at a time. It is heavier than I had expected to carry it around. If anyone wants to use it for classes and play games in-between, this is more than enough, as long as you don’t mind the weight of it.	3	6	3	3	0
Bought two of these, both had a few hours of updates out of the box, which is to be expected. Downloaded and installed Guild Wars 2 immediately (the reason I bought two of these, for me and my wife) it runs it perfectly on max settings at 70+ FPS. Fans only kicked in when I joined a heavily demanding pvp match and they were very quiet. As to be expected for a laptop it runs a little warm, but let’s be honest there’s a lot of demand on such a small package. Overall though it is a superbly fast computer that has thus far met and exceeded my expectations for a $700 laptop. Will update review after a week or so, hoping for more good reviews of it!	3	6	3	3	0
So far no complaints. About 2 weeks in so far and this laptop has peformed beyond what I expected. Not sure why everone is getting the wrong graphics card as mine definitely has the Ti. I mostly use this laptop for steam games and streaming online and so far it runs SpinTires and Rocket League at highest graphics settings while also running the webcam and recoeding software. Great laptop for the price!	3	6	3	3	0
So far I've been totally enjoying the experience on this laptop. It came with the parts needed to install an additional SSD or HDD which I bought separately and was more cost efficient might I add than buying the laptop with the 1TB HDD preinstalled. This laptop has not overheated and I have ran benchmark tests on this laptop as well as played for 6+ hours straight with games such as Lol, Dota 2, Overwatch, and Battlefront on full settings.Will give updates upon any change that takes place.	3	6	3	3	0
Great gaming laptop. Plays most AAA games with fault. Suggestion: when ordering this, order a 2tb hdd (7mm) to have a little more space. Very little bloatware, and since the startup system is on the ssd, it boots quite fast.	3	6	3	3	0
The wrong model was sent to me by a reseller, but the issue was resolved by Amazon. The computer itself is worth 5 stars.Superior to the more expensive MSI I got around the same time. Much better screen, even if it is a bit dim.PROS:Great hardware for the price, seems easy to upgrade the ram and HDD.Great screen for price. Great color and contrast. does not look washed out like other gaming laptop screens.Very fast SSD built in.Very easy to add an extra HDD.Great battery life. Over twice what I've seen for gaming laptops in the same price range. 8 hours if all settings are reduced. About 2 hours playing a mid-range game.CONS:Not enough to take a star off for, since it is still better than models that cost $200 more.Keyboard a bit cramped and will take some getting used to.Screen a little dim in sunlight.	3	6	3	3	0
"Was the Ti version gpu, had the HDD mount kit and cable pre installed. The screen bezzel on the bottom is SCARY flexible though if i press on it LIGHTLY from the back the front pops out about a .25"" which freaks the hell out of me. But otherwise seems ok. The built isn't the highest quality but its decent for a budget laptop. This thing literally boots in about 5 seconds to log on screen.Update:After doing a little gaming (BF3) performed very well fans are a little loud, doesnt get warm though. Suprised it only had 60ms latency when used with wifi with poor singal strength. Router is on thr other side of the house.."	3	6	3	3	0
We ordered this laptop for my gf. She loves this laptop so much we almost bought a laptop from Wal-Mart but I went with Amazon and this is far better than anything I could have got for this price. Works great and fast. I use it to play world of warcraft. And it plays on high settings perfect. I would definitely recommend this for a first time gaming laptop unless you have another 500 dollar to add this is best for the price.	3	6	3	3	0
"Since there are options for purchasing this laptop, this review is for the:""Acer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6"" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD""Pros:- GPU is awesome (Currently playing Ni No Kuni 2 and Overwatch with no problems)- Heat, while there, is pretty minimal- Easy to access extra internal SSD/HDD slotCons:- Extra internal SSD/HDD slot technically works, but it will often disconnect the drive (think USB thumb drive being removed).When I first got the laptop and installed the extra internal hard drive, everything was working really well! This lasted until about February and the hard drive started having intermittent connection issues. At first I had an HDD in there and though that the moving parts were malfunctioning so I put an SSD in there instead. Didn't fix the issue. Then I thought that perhaps the laptop wasn't providing power to the drive after a while due to power saving options and I disabled that. Didn't fix the issue. Maybe I didn't secure the drive well enough and it was moving around too much, so I placed it in a stationary place and got lucky enough to have the drive be recognized again. The issue was solved for about a day but ultimately didn't fix the issue. I still have not been able to access my SSD for longer than a few hours once every few weeks (so far it's been 6 days since it last showed up on my laptop).To be fair, I haven't talked with customer support, so they could possibly save the situation. I think the bottom line is that I would expect that paying any amount of money over $500 would mean that hardware problems would be minimized.Overall:The weight, GPU, CPU, feel of the material, and look of this laptop are great. I want to like the laptop, but the inability to consistently use the extra internal hard drive lowers the score. As such, I'd say this laptop is OK and would probably be worth buying between $600 and $700. For transparency, I was able to purchase this at $699.99."	3	6	3	3	0
"Very well designed low budget gaming laptop. I have been using it frequently for the last month or so, and it has worked great! My previous laptop had an issue with overheating on the games I liked to play, but this one handles them well. The GPU is powerful and stays cool, and the laptop is well designed, especially for the price.Cons:- Screen doesn't get very bright (Bright enough, but I'm used to just slightly more)- Cooling fans are pretty loud (Not too big a deal for me, I'd rather it be cool than quiet for gaming)- Battery life is not great but I expected thatPros:- SSD is so nice!- Model I purchased comes with an additional 2.5"" bay as well as a cord to plug in another HDD- GPU runs amazing and stays cool- CPU runs great for games and other programs- Windows touchpad drivers are really good- Installation was so simpleAll in all, I was very happy with this. It works great for what I want, and it came at a killer price for the SSD and GPU inside. There were no major corners cut creating this machine, and I am a very satisfied buyer.Update: Recently I added an HDD in the extra 2.5” bay and it connected without a problem. There was no additional work I had to do other than plugging it in. They even provided the screws!"	3	6	3	3	0
I want to say that Acer has done extremely well in marketing what is essentially a mid-range gaming computer for a very good price point indeed. Including shipping, I was able to get this machine for about $725 all told, which is an excellent for a computer with a quad core i5 and a 1050Ti; other machines with identical specifications retail for upwards of 900 dollars.I have yet to be disappointed; I've thrown almost all of the best games I have, including Gaijn's War-Thunder (2013) and Idea Factory's Cyberdimension Neptunia (2017) at this computer, and it handles them almost flawlessly at 1080p on maximum settings; in Cyberdimension Neptunia, which uses the Unreal 4 engine, there are a few hiccups down to 57fps when new effects come into play, but otherwise the system holds stead with barely any noticeable noise or heat; Warthunder never drops below about 77FPS. This is the machine you want if you want a budget gaming laptop that truly lives up to the advertising hype; the Nvidia GTX 1050Ti will be able to handle most items coming out within the next few years on medium-high settings at 1080p for at least the next 3-5 years.With that said, the computer gets four rather than five stars for a couple of reasons. First, because while the chassis is solid and well made, the IPS screen itself is a bit dim, and the plastic frame for it feels a bit fragile; it's certainly not made of as durable a material as the actual chassis. Second, because the audio seems a bit off; while this is a function of the extra subwoofer/ bass settings they seem to have added to the audio card, it makes the audio a bit less clear than on my older computer, an HP Envy 17 S143CL model, which was purchased for $800 in December 2016.	3	6	3	3	0
The Acer Nitro 5 feels very fragile. I was in constant fear of breaking it. Part of that is the fact that I dropped, all told, $750 on this piece of equipment and that makes you worry about those things, but the bigger part is that it's simply cheaply made. This laptop looks great on paper, and you KNOW they have to cut corners somewhere, right? Well Acer decided to sacrifice build quality here, and it shows. Well, it doesn't show, and that's the problem. You won't realize it's cheaply made until you actually get your hands on it; feel the tightness of the usb ports when you plug something in and wonder if they're going to break, as you place the laptop in your bag and have serious doubts about its ability to hold up to simple foot travel.In terms of hardware it really is a good deal, but there's a reason other laptops in this category go for several hundred dollars more. They are built to last. This isn't.Mine came with a defective screen. There was significant backlight bleed (yellow splotches of light around the edges of the screen that show up when dark colors are displayed) that got worse over the few weeks I owned it. Acer would cover a replacement screen under warranty and asked me to send it in. They wanted me to pay for shipping, but I asked them to cover shipping both ways because it was a manufacturing defect, and they agreed without any hassle. I'm upset that my brand-new PC was defective out of the gate and I had to ship it in for repairs. I returned it instead because I could not trust the build quality. Acer is a good brand but save up and get a predator instead.3 stars for the laptop. It's not actually that bad. Docked a star for poor quality control.	3	6	3	3	0
I got this laptop because I wanted to get into PC gaming. After owning this product for a few months, I can honestly say that I can recommend this product to anyone thinking about getting into computer gaming. It runs games like CoD WWII, Killing Floor 2, and other non-intensive games flawlessly. Ram and HDD/SDD are easily upgradeable.	3	6	3	3	0
"First off, for about $750 I do not believe you can beat this at all. I am not totally sure what SSD was ""supposed"" to come with this unit but my unit came with an Intel 600p pci-e SSD, to me to have an SSD of that class is great especially at this price point, while it is not the best, its better than a sata version, it also came with 8 gb ddr4 2400 MHZ ram. The screen is not perfect but it is still very nice. To get a 1050 Ti 4 gb, a true 7th gen quad core, a 1080p IPS display, and usb-c it is top notch. This is by no means a high end gaming rig, that is what my Ryzen 7 and GTX 1070 are for. This is great for a second computer or work machine to get work done and being able to game on the go as well. Power, speed, and features wise, this is as powerful as most regular desktops, if you are in the market do not hesitate to buy this. In my opinion anything more powerful should probably be a dedicated desktop anyways"	3	6	3	3	0
So far it's great! Audio, and picture quality is superb! Keys are responsive. It feels sturdy and not cheap. The design of the shell is awesome. Easy to setup. It does come with the 1050 Ti.How to check your graphics card to verify:From the Start menu, open the Run dialog box.Type dxdiag.Click on the Display tab of the dialog that opens to find graphics card information (for me it was window 2)	3	6	3	3	0
I spent days searching for the best laptop in the $800 range. As I ran into the Nitro 5 I saw many complaints of overheating and a bad thermal design. I ordered the laptop and hoped for the best. After recieving the laptop I ran the graphics on many games at ultra high or very high. The laptop kept a very stable temperature and ran the games smoothly. With that being said, it does come with a Gtx1050 although advertised as 1050ti (you can upgrade it to 1050ti for about $150 more when purchasing) but besides that everything is amazing. Great display, super fast, and decent speakers for a gaming laptop (don’t expect much base). If you’re searching for a gaming laptop or a laptop just for everyday use, I’d highly recommend this product.	3	6	3	3	0
Really good notebook however I strongly recommend adding 8GB of RAM... I did and I can run more demanding games with no issues...	3	6	3	3	0
I hope everyone had a great holiday and this is one of my 2017 Holiday gifts to myself. As for background please check out some of my reviews I enjoy tech and have reviewed several types of systems. I brought this system for one purpose to match it with my Samsung Odyssey VR Headset for Windows mixed reality.From a price standpoint you would be hard pressed to find another Gamming Laptop in this price range with these features. I searched the net and the pricing was the best here on Amazon. I set up the laptop with the Samsung headset on Christmas and it passed all the test with flying colors I used it most so far to play Space Pirates an excellent VR game. I also have installed Star Trek Bridge Crew and Arizona Sunshine for non VR I have the Division on it running at full 60FPS. The laptop allows my VR to run at the full 90hrz on all my VR Games I can confirm mine does have the 1050TI not the 1050. The Laptop came with no bloat wear and was easy to setup by voice. I am certain the one I got has the drive holder for me to add an additional drive to the system I did not get it to use it on battery power for any long periods of time I understand these laptop are not made to game for hours on end with just battery powerEven with the speakers faced down I still get great sound from them and the screen being matt is a pleasure glossy screens are to me over rated. Start up time is very fast and if you want to really use this laptop you will need an additional drive the included 256Gigs will fill up fast. This is I think one of if not the best first Gamming Laptop you can get and still be under $1000.00 If you have the cash and can afford a $1000.00+ machine then go for it but for me this hit a very nice sweet spot and it means I can take my VR on the road to let friends play with it.	3	6	3	3	0
I downloaded World of Warships, and it handles it very well. Easily gets 75 fps, on highest settings and the graphics are great on screen. I also added a 128gb ssd, which turned out to be a very quick and easy upgrade. the wiring and plug were there inside the access panel and it just took a few minutes to do. Battery life is fine as long as I'm just surfing the web. I always have it hooked to ac power when game playing though. I've used the wifi to connect to mobile hotspot on my iPhone and it works very well. I've also used the Bluetooth for a gaming headset. I've also downloaded and played World of Tanks on this laptop at highest settings....gets same framerate as on my pc at home.	3	6	3	3	0
This laptop is my first gaming laptop and I love it. It runs very well with the help of intel i5. This game easily runs games like Overwatch at 60 fps and never crashes. The keyboard feels very nice and is very quiet. The backlit feature is very good-looking and lights up the keys just enough to see them in the dark. The cooling system can keep the temperature of the laptop down enough that it does not have any problems. This machine also has the ability for you to add an extra hard drive in case you need it. Screws are included in the box so that if you decide to buy another hard drive, you can install it right away. One problem that I do have that I have seen other people having is that my laptop will randomly shut off when not charging. I am not sure why this happens but I just though I should include this in my review. Otherwise, this laptop is a great buy for those who want an affordable laptop that can game and get work done. I highly recommend it and hope the buyers love it as well.	3	6	3	3	0
Impressed by the speed and performance and all the features. However, would have liked it better if the battery was easier to replace. This model has a built-in battery that can be changed if you open the whole thing up, which I will regret later on when I have to, but, for the rest, it's perfect.As a software developer, it's perfect for programming as well!!	3	6	3	3	0
I absolutely love this laptop. It's the only gaming 2-in-1 ultrabook I've ever found, and I've been searching for years. It also offers both a SSD and separate storage HDD, a surprise at this size and price. The only thing I'd change is the power port - I worry about the durability of standard laptop power connectors, but this one may prove to be perfectly durable.	3	6	3	3	0
I bought this laptop for gaming and working. It fulfils my requirements: runs PUBG at 1080P High settings at mid-50s FPS.I do not identify any thermal issues with my device. I am surprised at how good the speakers sound. The screen is acceptable, not great. Built quality is decent.	3	6	3	3	0
Works fine. Plays the games I need it to play. Boots fast. Like the lighted keyboard, however, the keyboard is VERY hard to see without the power supply plugged supply because the lighted keyboard only work with the power supply attached. The keys become totally black without the light. There should be a way to use the KB light without the power supply.	3	6	3	3	0
Pros. Great performance and graphics. A good buy for the price. I play far cry 3-5 plus primal. Also fallout 3,Vegas,and 4. Love it.Cons. No CD,DVD, blue ray. The sound/speakers suck. There fine in a quiet environment. Storage space is small but very very fast.	3	6	3	3	0
Great hardware spec, good looks, bargain price. What more could you want in a gaming laptop. Only con is there is only 1 usb3.0 connection and 2 usb2.0. this can easily be fixed with a USB hub though so not a deal breaker for me. If you had a little more cash to play with the Acer Predator Helios is another good buy, $350 more but you get an i7 and a gtx1060.	3	6	3	3	0
"Great Laptop for the Price.Has a 2.5"" drive bay for a HDD or SSD.Ram with heat spreader shielding do not fit well, so it can be a challenge to fit."	3	6	3	3	0
Very solid build for the price.Pros:-Higher than average battery life-Very Beautiful Screen-Extremely value worthy proposition for the specs, next best price is +$350-For the price the materials are niceCons:-Bulky Power Supply-Only Scales to 1050ti in current iteration- Low storage on lower end models( easy to upgrade though)	3	6	3	3	0
Great budget system. I had to add a 500GB ssd to the available expansion tray, but that was easy. Runs all the games I've played on high settings and no problems so far. I mostly play FPS games online in multiplayer, BF1, BF4, Titan Fall, Battlefront 2, etc.. I don't get any stutter or lag and I use the cheap, but reliable, G602 wireless mouse and a DIY lapdesk that is foldable, for the best portable budget system.	3	6	3	3	0
This laptop has all the features it's supposed to, but a couple days after arrival it started having sudden battery disconnects, which turned out to be connected to a screw in the bottom that wasn't properly tight. After fixing that, it has started having overheating issues when I play games like Skyrim or Starcraft 2, and it has frozen up several times, which I've traced to the hard drive and/or ram running at 100%. Still a good computer for the price, but after these issues I would definitely recommend adding the extra ram card and HDD in the hopes that they would fix these problems. Fortunately these parts are accessible through hatches in the back, so I will be adding them as I am able.	3	6	3	3	0
Works great, though battery doesn't last quite as long as I hoped. Even with mild use (only browsing the internet) the battery life fluctuates between 2-4 hours.	3	6	3	3	0
My son wanted this for his pc gaming. He is a hardcore gamer and needed something much better than out year old desktop. He is really pleased with this and if you knew how hard he is to please with the geology items you would probably think this was the best computer ever made because I do now (lol).	3	6	3	3	0
I love my new laptop I can play games like Destiny 2 & The Division, basically any game I want to play at really good settings. I love the fact that it has a USB type-c port so I can charge my phone on it. I carry it everywhere with me, it replaced my Surface and I couldn't be happier.	3	6	3	3	0
This thing rocks, i been using it for a week now and its just great, only problem is no HHD space, but it can be upgraded, there is a spot to install an HHD and comes with 4 screws for instaling the hhd you buy. 1050 ti got it only a amazons choice deal 660 dollars, shit is beast mode for that price.	3	6	3	3	0
I love this laptop. I'm a huge gamer so when I got sick and couldn't make it upstairs to my desktop, I was worried I wouldn't be able to play my games. I was hesitant to get a laptop, but I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics and audio are amazing and flawless. It plays League of Legends, Minecraft, Rust, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more on high settings. This was really worth every penny.	3	6	3	3	0
Wanted to love this laptop. Faithful to Acer for years. Screen bleeds extremely bad. Top of computer gets scratched very easily. When keys are being used for games, touchpad is unresponsive. Wish I would have returned it. Use my 6 year old Acer more than this garbage. Never again!	3	6	3	3	0
This computer is a beast for the price. Been using it nonstop for about a 2 weeks.Picture is really nice HD displayConstruction material qualities is nicer then expected at this price rangeSound is nice qualityWould be 5 stars but I was very nervous opening the packing because the box was damaged and the packing wasn't great but everything was fine.And I have 1050ti	3	6	3	3	0
Decent laptop overall, but great laptop on a budget. Does feel pretty plasticky, but it’s ok. My only problem is with the WiFi repeatedly switching, but that can be solved with an Ethernet cable. It can run Minecraft with intense shaders, Planet Coaster (although frames are dropped), Fortnite, PUBG, and everyday tasks well. Video processing should be ok if it is light, but it might not be able to handle intense graphic editing. Overall great laptop for the price.	3	6	3	3	0
Overall for this price range I don’t think you can do much better. The FPS for rocket league, fortnite, and csgo are acceptable (above 60, 120ish for RL). I use it to watch videos/browse and play games when I’m traveling. I would buy it again.	3	6	3	3	0
Great laptop for the given price. It IS a 1050TI. Don't regret buying it.Pros:Boots up very quicklyHandles games well (stays quiet & keeps cool)Type-C portSD Card portBig screenDecent battery lifeKeyboard feels very similar to a desktop one.Cons:Heavy (but as expected from a gaming laptop)Touchpad is terrible. I fly a lot, so ideally I'd just pop out my laptop and start gaming. That's a no with this frustrating touchpad.	3	6	3	3	0
"In the event that I actually received the laptop I ordered, this would be a perfect review. But that didn't happen.I ordered a GTX 1050 Ti. That was very much specified in my order. And I bought the laptop immediately after Thanksgiving. Upon receiving the package, I felt something was amiss, because the box - and the laptop itself - had stated it ran on the base GTX 1050 GPU. I conducted a few tests on this front, mostly in regard to gaming (Overwatch, to be specific) and the frame-rate of that title between a 1050 and 1050ti. In short, let's say it was obvious I didn't get what I purchased. I'm sorry - but why the confusion here?Because I'll admit: it's a fantastic piece of hardware minus the somewhat flimsy plastic design around the edges of the keyboard andAcer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6"" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, AN515-51-55WL screen, and my aforementioned issue."	3	6	3	3	0
I really enjoy this laptop. Probably my favorite owned laptop so far. It runs the Oculus Rift surprisingly well; I haven't had any problems running any VR games I've tried so far. Pleasantly surprised. If you're planning on going the most cost-effective way to get into VR, this is it.A couple of small things I've noticed, good and not-so-good:I love the way the keyboard feels. The material is nice, as well as the way the keys feel when pressed. It just feels nice to me.The housing between the keyboard and trackpad flexes rather easily. This isn't a problem, but it's also not a good thing.I enjoy the way the trackpad feels; it's a nice and smooth material.The overall look of the laptop in general is nice, in my opinion.Though this model supports a Core i5 processor, it's actually faster than a lot of available Core i7 processors, so if you're shopping based on processor power, you can pretty much count this as an i7 - unless you're shopping for hardcore gaming.The key shapes can be a little strange, but only for keys that aren't often used. Some, such as the numpad, look a little squished - rectangular.Overall, I was second-guessing my decision to buy this laptop while waiting for its arrival, but I have been consistently and pleasantly surprised with this machine so far. Very well worth the money.	3	6	3	3	0
Well have had it for about 6 days and no problems. I run BOINC (Seti@home) service so the processor, memory and video card have been running at about 90% 24/7 during this time. No hiccups at all. The wireless is phenomenal using the MIMO connections. I have a TP-LINK Router that supports MU-MIMO so they work great together. The system at times is a little slow even with the BOINC service shut down but I guess I'm just used to the performance of my AMD FX-8350 8 core 4Ghz processor in the big PC. I'll get used to it :-)I like the expansion on this laptop, room for a standard hard drive and two slots for memory expansion (1 already has the 8GB installed.) I'll probably upgrade the 256GB SSD with a larger one in the near future, 256 is a bit small.I'm doing my families Genealogy and since my old laptop was literally falling apart, this will be great asset when I go home and do some more research.I think this is a keeper, I've had Acer laptops in the past and had good luck with them. I'll keep you posted on any issues that may arise in the future, for now I'm very satisfied.	3	6	3	3	0
Great screen only thing I didn’t realize is that it doesn’t have a rom drive.	3	6	3	3	0
Great laptop with no problems. Doesn't overheat at all while gaming. Also, the sata and the HDD caddy were included with my laptop and after seeing other reviews i'm happy about this. The specs are good for the price tbh. Don't expect to run high demanding games at ultra settings tho. it's a med-range gaming laptop.	3	6	3	3	0
Bought two of these to play overwatch with my wife after two of our older computers started having issues. They run the game well on low settings at 130-150 fps. Good screens and don't get hot.	3	6	3	3	0
Works great for all of my games and photoshop now runs 10x faster than on my last computer. I'm writing this review on this.	3	6	3	3	0
Excellent when it works. It is now dead. The screen started to strobe. It wouldn't open programs, which I had to reinstall. Then it quietly switched itself off...with a full battery...and it won't re-start. Since the battery is integral, there is no resetting it by removing and replacing the battery. Will trouble shoot but little more than two months of light use and it is dead? Disappointing.	3	6	3	3	0
This laptop is a well rounded laptop not only for gaming but everything else such as browsing the web, watching movies or typing notes. The only downside is that the battery doesn't last very long after usage. This is expected as it has a powerful CPU and GPU.	3	6	3	3	0
So far this laptop is what I was expecting! A quality computer for decent gaming. I can use fairly decent graphic settings on my games and still get a good FPS it has an awesome design and isn’t too bulky. The keyboard is kind of close together but it’s a laptop what do you expect. I was however disappointed with amazon’s delivery packaging. They used a box much larger than the laptop box itself which could have risked the computers safety.	3	6	3	3	0
This is a pretty cool laptop. Aesthetically it's really pleasing. the keyboard has red back lighting (these are the only LED's and they dont change colors) and it has some subtle but cool red accenting. One thing that did suck was that After having it about two weeks, the screen started freaking out. I have a warranty for it so I do plan on sending it back to get that fixed. If I move the screen in a certain position everything is fine. Other than the odd screen issue, I'm pretty happy with this laptop. At 15 inches, it's rather large, but the screen is a decent IPS 1080p panel. Full size keyboard, no windows precision drivers on the touchpad, so that is a little hard to use but a mouse makes that more manageable. No disk tray, 3 usb ports (one of them is a 3.0, the other two are 2.0), ethernet, usb c, and full size hdmi. Mine has the gtx 1050ti, which I would definitely recommend, It can run most new games at medium settings at around 60fps. I wouldnt recommend running this for gaming on battery power though , If youre using the graphics card the battery only lasts about an hour. Otherwise, just for web browsing or working the battery lasts about 4 hours. Its not great, but you get what you pay for. Decent build quality, a good looking laptop and decent performance. Overall I would recommend this to others	3	6	3	3	0
Computer is great and very quick out of the box. Has a Intel m.2 ssd so thats a good thing. There was a slight problem when I got my package and that was the bad thing. The seal on the Acer Nitro box was opened and covered up by another of the same sticker and was really suspicious because the description of this item was new.edit: one week later and it fails to boot.... and the fans really crank up when gaming.	3	6	3	3	0
Wow what a fantastic computer! Updated it and starting throwing down on mechs right out of the box. Love it. Will probably add HDD in the future. It is well worth the money because I'm totally on a budget.	3	6	3	3	0
This is probably the best bang for you will get if you want a laptop. Honestly anything more and I would say you should just build an at home rig. This will run destiny 2 at 60fps in highest settings (while plugged in) so basically it will play just about anything you could want. Just note battery life is about 1-2 hours off the charger and will throttle back FPS and screen brightness.. got mine when it was on sale for $699.	3	6	3	3	0
Great laptop, it can run pretty much anything you throw at it in good quality. Just make sure you download gpu-z to check if your 1050ti is there mine was but the on board software only picks up the integrated graphics which gave me a bit of a scare. All in all fantastic purchase and would 100% recommend to anybody trying to game on a budget.	3	6	3	3	0
Pros:Very fast boot,great vga for the most apps and games,nice backlight keyboard,good variety of portsCons:The screen is mediocre,low battery capacityFor the cost is a very good choise , and iam very happy for the purchase and for the price tha i bought the laptopUntil now i have not found anything wrong about this laptop except the mediocre ips screen	3	6	3	3	0
Laptop is really fantastic! My only issue is the speakers crackle when it starts and when it plays any type of media at a medium to loud volume. Other than that it plays games really well. Got it so I could play games like Elder Scrolls Online, Fortnite, 7 Days to Die, and Age of Empires Definitive edition. So far it’s played 7 days to die and age of empires on max settings with no problem. Would recommend!	3	6	3	3	0
Use this at work for a few games, runs well, havent had it freeze up or anything. plays TheHunter: all of the Wild excellently! Very happy and satisfied with it.	3	6	3	3	0
Fantatic beast of a laptop, it completely out performs my desktop which I put together just 3 years ago. It disperses the heat of the cpu/gpu very well, so much so that I have played a high demaind game whil the laptop was actually on my lap.	3	6	3	3	0
It arrived sooner than the original delivery date which I love. It can be a little slow at times but It’s perfect for what I play which is the sims. It can handle the extra expansion packs for sure. Quality is very good. I do recommend it.	3	6	3	3	0
I have had this laptop for a month now, and used it enough to feel like I can give a proper review:I would have given this 4 stars, but it wouldn't feel right. For the money, this laptop is absolutely phenomenal. I have a desktop that is my main rig (i7-8700k, two 1080ti, 64gb ram etc..) so this one was going to be for travel gaming and school/work computer programming. I have used it for all of the games and programs I use it for and it has yet to ever let me down. Games in 60 FPS no problem with high settings. I can play HOTS with my friends with no worry of losing frames or horrible stuttering. I even ran some 3D Mark tests and the 1050ti scored WAY higher than I expected. Heat stays pretty low and I have absolutely zero complaints except for one super minor thing:The reason for the possible 4 stars - the laptop is black and shows where my hands rest. It is a super picky reason to almost drop a star, which is why I did not. I almost always have microfiber towels with me, so I just wipe it down quick and it's good to go!I will be upgrading the RAM from 8gb to 32gb and then adding a 1TB HDD to the empty bay for more game and program storage. Sucks that things are so expensive right now but it is what it is!	3	6	3	3	0
good one, get hot when i play PUBG and OVERWATCH. but act just fine	3	6	3	3	0
I'm using this computer for work as well as playing League of Legends and WoW. It runs both of them very well and the start up time with the SSD is about 10 seconds. The keys have a solid feel of mechanical, but aren't super noisy, so I'm not bothering my coworkers. Loving it and very happy with my purchase!	3	6	3	3	0

UPDATE: Returned the original laptop, and re-ordered. The new laptop came with the correct (1050Ti) graphics card. Extremely happy with the laptop and the customer service!Laptop itself is great. Performs well and has solid feel. Like others here, I received a GTX 1050 graphics card, not the GTX 1050Ti. Had to contact Amazon and return for a refund, but customer service was very helpful. If you order this, make sure you receive the 1050Ti.	3	6	3	3	0
After a few days after purchase, I must say that this is a fantastic purchase for the price. Granted, I do not keep up with recent laptop technology as it hits the market, but compared to the Asus laptop that i have upgraded from that was new about 4 years ago, this product is an entirely new generation from my previous experience. I must say that still, after years of development the track pads of these more affordable laptops are still not nearly as good as the front runners, such as apple. Even with this downfall, the performance with the SSD makes the operating system really snappy and the ability to upgrade the RAM adds and included bonus for performance. This is by no means a performance gaming system that will deliver 4k or VR capabilities, but if you are looking for a decent, well priced laptop with incredible potential for general use, artistic and occasional gaming capabilities, this is the product you have been looking for! The keyboard feels nice, backlit keys(in just the red LED) is nice, 2 in 1 maneuverability is surprisingly useful(I like to put it into tent mode with a PS4 controller when I'm gaming), screen looks great, touchscreen is surprisingly responsive, speakers are better than expected, the red accenting looks nice and you just can't complain about what you have paid for. The only thing I would ask for is a more narrow bezel on the screen, but really, what does that matter?	3	6	3	3	0
Good cost-performance. However, the open source nVidia graphics card driver on Linux has bugs and it will cause the system freeze. So please only use the Intel integrated graphics card driver or try the nVidia official close source driver if you will install Linux on this laptop.	3	6	3	3	0
Great on the go light gaming machine for the money. Thermal trottles to all hell anytime something heavy work load is thrown at it. Poorly designed fan placement.	3	6	3	3	0

"This could have been a great laptop, except for one irritating and one fatal flaw. The irritation was the significant light bleed in several corners and along two sides of the screen. I know the difference between ""normal"" IPS glow, and light bleed due to poor manufacturing and quality control. This was the latter. The panel is simply bonded too tightly with the chassis, and slightly warped in a few places, so that the LCD screen is compressed and lets through too much light from the LED's behind it.The second, and really inexcusable flaw, was a loose touchpad that made a clicking/rattling noise with every touch, swipe, or any other contact between my fingers and the pad. Not just button presses, but any touch made this noise. It was incredibly distracting. How Acer lets products in this condition make it out of the factory is beyond me. Do they really expect people to keep something like this? So this laptop got returned, and it's time to try a different brand."	3	6	3	3	0

Great gaming laptop for the money. I'll start out saying i really only play World of Warcraft and a few simple games on steam, but for that purpose, I've found only minor faults with this machine. Wow runs smoothly even in new areas with dense player load, but this is on a custom setting i use that's below ultra but above middle of the road. Pros: great performance for the money, looks good, solid build quality, decent battery. Cons: sound quality through stock speakers is lackluster, keyboard lighting features are basically nonexistent, 1050ti already technically outdated, but solid for the price point, cooling fan is a bit loud. I realize it may sound like im beating up on a computer i gave 5 stars, but I could not find something better for the price.	3	6	3	3	0
Laptop for our son, battery drains fast, but it was on the reviews, other than that works well.	3	6	3	3	0
The biggest problem I have with this computer is that it will shut off at random times for no apparent reason. It is not overheating and it can happen whether using 5 windows or none. No rhyme or reason. The other thing that is annoying is that this computer boasts its graphics capability, but bogs down with simple video editing. This was a large reason for my purchase of this computer.It is hard to see a plus with this computer with the intermittent power issues. I have read that others experience the same now and there is little resolution available. I guess I can say that it is working for the time it takes to write this review.	3	6	3	3	0

It is a great laptop and for the money its simply awesome. I bought it for school work and some occasional gaming (I know it's more of a gaming laptop but I prefer more graphics than no graphics ;) ). I personally am not a huge gamer, so I allowed my brother to check for fps and stuff. He was getting 60-65 fps on Rainbow Six Siege on medium setting all around and about 30 fps on extremely high settings. I have been using the laptop for a couple of hours now and it feels great and runs smooth. I will update my ratings if something goes wrong (hoping it won't).There is however one big flaw: The track pad feels just awful. Thankfully I had ordered a mouse beforehand so its not a issue for me.Edit: after an entire semester of coding classes, I am extremely happy with the performance. For gaming part, it gets hot after about half an hour of heavy gaming but works fine with lower end gaming and school work.	3	6	3	3	0

Had high hopes for this laptop. I knew there would be some heat issues as a lot of people have pointed out but I looked past that since I could buy a cooling pad for it. Build is good, was actually a bit impressed. M.2 was super fast on booting. Played Rocket league and PUBG very well. However, it started to turn off randomly.. I had it for a week before that started happening. The weird thing was that it only happened when I was running on battery. Will be returning this laptop...	3	6	3	3	0

When it works it works well, but that rarely every happens.

"Hey everyone....this laptop rocks....it is seriously awesome! I don't understand what other users are moaning about. I've read through other comments before buying and some were complaining about it being noisy, or too hot....I've experienced nothing like it. After playing fornite for 3 hours straight the laptop is barely even warm.....far from hot....the fan is on but it is very quiet....I,ve set the game setting to ""epic"" quality and still getting easy 60 frames per second. The HD is definitely NVME....super fast...the laptop boots in 5 seconds....I am vey happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!"	3	6	3	3	0
Only bad thing is that the battery shuts off randomly when unplugged....and by the time you find out....you can't return it. Very light, screen somehow broke with light handling. I have had many laptops that were more durable where the screen never broke. For the price, it shouldn't be so flimsy. Acer support team is incompetent. This was my first & last Acer product. Go with a Dell or Toshiba or HP or something.	3	6	3	3	0

Works as advertised, bought it for my brother, and overall its running as it should. Some reviews made note that they got the 1050 instead of the 1050ti, but this one came with the -ti variant as displayed. His only issue with the computer is that the games dont run as well of the charger as they do on it, and that the headphone jack for this laptop is extremely loose. Not sure if poor quality or faulty, but regardless its a downside to buying this.	3	6	3	3	0
Acer Biom are not smooth and stable, had to update it to Insyde Software. Graphic cards and stuff runs great on ultra settings, but started lagging when playing 8-bit games. Which is weird and I don't understand. Probably it's a faulty laptop or It's just Acer. The more I use it, the more problems occur, which gets really annoying. So I have no choice, but to refund it and find a better gaming laptop brand instead.	3	6	3	3	0

This machine is really fast, and it does run games nicely. What I do NOT like, is the keyboard. The back lighting is not easy to see, and if it is running on battery, the keyboard turns off completely. Virtually impossible to see the letters in the dark. I would also appreciate being able to change the color from red to almost any other color. I erroneously thought it might be configurable, but alas, you are stuck with red. Very nice screen, and the sound is pretty good, too. Very solid feeling. Very good cooling capability, as well.	3	6	3	3	0

Bought this computer this month got it the first week of March and the screen is already cracked. I'm not sure what happened but I have only used it a couple of times and this happens. I'm not sure what to do. It's not very usable with a cracked screen and it cost too much money to just get another computer. I've had several computers and never had a screen crack!	3	6	3	3	0

I’m not a gamer or hobby level computer engineer. This won’t be that kind of review.I am a tactile person. I appreciate how things look and feel. I enjoy the feel of quality design, and construction.First let me say I enjoy the aesthetic of this computer. The brushed metal with a matt black, and red accents is both interesting and exciting. This will be the primary computer for my 11 year old. He loves gaming, and graphic design. He is currently working on a comic book, and I know he will make great use of this computer for his creations.I absolutely loved the setup. This is a windows machine. I have not set up a windows machine in years. We have mostly used iPads and iPhones for most of the last decade. I’ve purchased and set up many of those. They are simple for sure, but this windows machine made setup interesting. Now maybe that says more about windows than Acer, but it’s included. I enjoyed it. So it’s in the review.Why was the setup so interesting? Cortanna. The whole set up was voice controlled. She spoke, I answered, and she did the setup. I felt like I was at a pro desk, having a knowledgeable customer service rep set it up for me.The screen has a matte finish, and feels a little plasticy. This may be a side effect from coming from iPads, which have glass screens. But I think I do prefer the look of glass. I do think the matte finish helps reduce glare. So this computer would likely, literally shine, out doors. It’s a bit big, in my view, to be easily portable. But I’m sure kids and teens lug these around. I prefer the iPhone 7 Plus for portability. Anything bigger than an iPad mini is staying at home.The machine attaches to WiFi quickly and easily, and with stability. Thanks to google, most of my settings were there after setup and google log in.The back lit keyboard is a neat feature. The keyboard it’s self provides a nice tactile experience. Key strokes feel fluid, and smooth. The keys feel more rubber or silicone, than plastic. Their motion seems to have been intentionally engineered for a positive user experience.The hardware inside is sufficient for any computer tasks I threw at it. I had numerous windows open at once, everything from shopping, to video streaming, to audio streaming. No hiccups, or glitches.	3	6	3	3	0
"Right off let me say I'm really impressed with this laptop. Here are my thoughts:FORM FACTOR: This laptop is intended for gaming, so while it's definitely portable it's bigger and heavier than a general-use laptop. The case is really attractive; I love the brushed-aluminum look, and the unit overall looks sharp and slightly aggressive without looking gaudy, although the case does attract fingerprints. Overall the unit feels solid and well built.DISPLAY: I really like the display. Despite being an IPS display the color and clarity looked great to me, although you do need to view the screen from directly in front for best quality. The screen size and resolution are absolutely perfect; it's nice and sharp with great pixel density but not so much that you have to use Windows' clunky scaling feature.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is not bad. Key travel is good and it was comfortable to type on. I like that it has a keypad. The one thing I didn't like is that the keys are black with dark-red lettering. This is fine with the keyboard backlight is on, but if you're running on battery and the backlight is off it's nearly impossible to see what's printed on the keys. This can be a problem even if you know your way around a keyboard since a lot of the keys are smaller and closer-spaced than a full-size keyboard.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is what I would call middle of the road. Not great but it gets the job done. If you're going to be doing any kind of gaming you should absolutely have an external mouse.SOUND: The audio is the one thing that really surprised me--it's fantastic, the best I've ever heard from a laptop, and even better than some desktop speakers I've used. The sound is nice and full and doesn't have that thin ""AM radio"" sound that a lot of laptops have. The stereo separation when you're sitting in front of the computer is terrific as well.PERFORMANCE: I knew the specs were pretty good before using the laptop and it didn't disappoint. I was able to run a bunch of my favorite games just fine, including some CPU/GPU intensive ones. As long as you're not the kind of person that needs to have every graphics-quality slider at maximum this laptop gets the job done. I will say when the computer is running full tilt the case fan spins like crazy and is quite loud, but this is pretty typical for laptops. When the computer is not running full tilt it's fairly quiet.CONCLUSION: This is a great budget gaming laptop and represents a fantastic value. It feels solid and well built, looks nice, and performs great for gaming on a budget."	3	6	3	3	0

My daughter’s HP laptop started giving up the ghost and she needed a replacement fairly quickly. I have had great luck with Acer laptops in the past so I thought I would try the Acer Nitro 5.My first impression is that this laptop was a bit bigger and heavier than most of the laptops I have purchased in recent years. The casing feels to be mostly of plastic. While it is solid and sturdy feeling, it does give it a bit of a cheap feeling.My daughter mainly uses the PC for academics and light gaming. For this, the PC has performed superbly.The only thing I thought was just OK was the sound quality. I know that laptops generally do not have good sound quality, but I thought the speakers and sound in this laptop were a bit mediocre. The sound was not terrible, but it sure was not excellent either.Personally, I loved the HD screen on this PC. The light up keyboard is a nice touch I thought. Battery life runs about 5 to 6 hours with surfing and online use.After about 6 months of use, the laptop is still running like a champ. I have yet to encounter an issue.Overall, I have been very happy with this laptop. I would highly recommend this latptop for someone looking for a good laptop at a good price.	3	6	3	3	0
Got this laptop from Costco. This has a 1050 with 4 gb of vram. Basically the 1050 time has a little bit more cuda core than the 1050. This has the 1050 chip in it with 4 gb of vram instead of 2. I don't care as it plays games great. The one issue I have is the control key. It's way to short for gaming. There's a full size one on the other side of the keyboard but not on the left. If they just switched the fn key to the other side where the Volume and brightness keys are then it would have been fine	3	6	3	3	0
Using 3 generations of iMac at home for the last 12 years, I was reluctant to get a PC laptop. However, my work gave me a Dell with a solid state drive and i7 processor and in many ways, including its quick boot-up, it was more appealing than my iMac at home. Additionally, to get equal specs of solid state drive in a Mac, you have to spend double. So for a home laptop, the Acer Nitro 5, with an i5 processor, seemed like enough for my casual needs: writing on Google docs, surfing net, and watching movies on Netflix.Taking the Nitro out of the box, it looks with its 15.6-inch screen like a large laptop, big enough to be a desktop replacement. It is a very attractive laptop--modern, solid, and red-light keys that light up as you type. This is not a touch screen, but the touch-pad can give you a lot of the touch screen experience with the various two-finger swipes.Set-up was about 15 minutes as you enter your data into the Microsoft system. For me, the most desirable user experience is to do my work on Google Chrome, use Google Docs, and use all the same bookmarks from that browser. The Acer Nitro seems very capable and moves as quickly as my i7 Dell.A word about sound: On Netflix, the Dolby speaker sound is excellent; however, the sound was tinny on Spotify. Probably, the old jazz recording didn't sound well on Spotify. Probably better recordings would sound better though the speakers.For the aforementioned purposes, this Nitro i5 suits my purposes and is a very pleasant user experience. If you do more applications and need a workhorse for a laptop PC, I recommend an i7 processor with 512 GB SSD and 16 GB RAM, but for my purposes, the Nitro 5 has everything I need. Recommended.	3	6	3	3	0
I got mine from Costco for $599 - overall it’s a really sweet laptop for the price. I dropped an $140 to add 8gb of ram for 16gb total and a 1tb external hard drive. I mostly will use this for video and picture editing despite what some have said is not the most color accurate monitor in the world. It’s good enough for my needs. I plan to pick up an additional 2tb internal drive for another $80 or so bucks. For the price, I think it’s the only laptop under 1k to have a 4gb 1050 graphics card. The Costco version does not come with the ti but it does have the quick access panels for adding the ram and hard drive and the hard drive tray built in.	3	6	3	3	0
"I got this laptop from Costco about 3 months ago. Performance wise, this laptop is a killer for the price (I got mine for $649). Even though I have the lower power 1050 (not 1050 Ti) version, it still gets 1080p 60+fps on modern games, with high (but usually not ultra) graphics settings. Concerns about thermal throttling are mostly unfounded. Even while playing games that max out my computer's performance, temperatures never go above about 80C (hot but not enough to damage hardware) and I don't experience FPS drops, but it does get loud and warm to the touch.Its build quality feels like a typical $600-$700 laptop - sturdy but not premium. There isn't too much flexing and no creaking, but I've had some subtle clicking noises from the touchpad that sound like something loose. Those are gone now. The plastic on the top gets scratched easily, and the entire laptop attracts fingerprints. The keyboard's individual keys don't feel very nice, but surprisingly gave a very nice typing experience. It gets 6 hours of battery of very light usage, 4 hours of heavier browsing. I haven't tried playing games on battery. The screen is not really bright enough to use near direct sunlight, but does fine in the shade. Turn the brightness down for much better battery life. The screen's colors are okay, just a cheap IPS screen.The laptop comes with lots of bloatware from the factory. What I found most annoying was that the power button was controlled by Acer's software. Once I uninstalled all of it, the power button only can shut down and turn on the computer. There is a keyboard shortcut to sleep, though. The computer also has no physical indication of whether Caps Lock is on, that was also shown by the bloatware.Other stuff: webcam is average, speakers are average, keyboard lighting is nice, has 3 usb and 1 usb-c (no thunderbolt) plus RJ45 ethernet and headset jack, nice angled power connector, is not too thick or heavy. Mine didn't come with a cable to upgrade the hard drive. 256GB is enough for general usage, but you can't install large games.Overall, though, this is a great laptop in the ""value gaming laptop"" market, and well worth your money."	3	6	3	3	0
Have had it for a month, it works relatively alright . The speakers which sometimes spaz out and need a restart to be fixed, or they're just way too low for some reason (at random). The touchscreen has gotten wonky sometimes and the heating... Oh God the heating. It's gotten hot from drawing on Photoshop and playing indie games. Cooling systems aren't a recommendation but a necessity for this machine. Acer could have fixed the heating and I wouldn't really complain about the rest tbh.	3	6	3	3	0
I used to wonder why anyone would need to spend more than $200 on a laptop (or $139 for the fully functional laptop that I got at a Thanksgiving day sale a couple of years ago). And I still think that, if you are on a very tight budget, that is the way to go. But if you can afford it, these gaming laptops really do give you better performance and better experience. It is not always that you get a faster CPU (although the CPU may have improved functionality that is not always revealed by the clock speed), sometimes you are also getting significantly better graphics and sound cards/chips or more cached memory. And this Acer Nitro laptop does have all that with a really beautiful screen all packaged up in a sleek case.We are not using this machine for gaming (although I ran a few gaming benchmark tests like Heaven and was impressed at the brilliant graphics and speed and heat management) but the improved performance, like fast screen updating, works just fine for non-gaming users.You get NO HARD DISK but you do get 256 gigs of SSD and that certainly performs faster than a hard disk. I have to say that I still like my computers to come with a hard disk and Acer will provide you with the necessary hardware to insert your own disk drive. For now, I have no desire to open up and look inside this machine - instead I salvaged a fairly new 2-terabyte Firecuda sata drive from a desktop that I retired - stuck the drive in an external USB 3.0 drive enclosure. My external drive works just fine - I cannot boot from it but why would I want to when I can boot from the SSD. If you want your laptop to be really portable, you will probably want to use an internal drive rather than an external one.	3	6	3	3	0
Hands down the BEST DEAL in budget gaming laptop. A genuine quad core i5 processor, gtx 1050Ti, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, for only 700 bucks? Expect this beast to run any triple A titles on medium settings @1080p with a solid 60 frames per second.	3	6	3	3	0
The information provided by the seller is unreliable, since this device is completed with GTX1050, not GTX1050Ti !	3	6	3	3	0
I received the laptop with the gtx 1050 and not the gtx 1050 ti. currently waiting for a response from the seller about this issue.

Will continue to update after further testing.	3	6	3	3	0

I am not a gamer, but needed a laptop as I am mostly a Mac user, but my company uses PCs. This Laptop is very fast, comes with Windows 10 loaded and little else. That gave me the ability to add the software I wanted. Most of my software comes from subscription services and they loaded quickly and easily.The keyboard took getting used to as it lights up in red, but at night or in the early AM when I want to do some stealth computer work, it really lights up the keyboard so I can work in low or no light.While it is not lightweight, it is light for the size and very sleek. The resolution is awesome and better than any other PC I have used. (Most recently Lenovo and IBM Thinkpad). It is sharp and wonderful for viewing photos and other graphics. The color is true too.I am new to Windows 10 and am getting emails on how to work that. I've been a Windows 7 user. Windows 10 is like a poor man's version of Apple's newest OS system, but that does not detract from this powerful PC.The price is the best thing. Very reasonable for what you get.	3	6	3	3	0
Very nice. :D	3	6	3	3	0
Very happy with this comparatively inexpensive laptop. Inexpensive when compared to other souped up gamer models. This has more juice than I would have expected for the price. The display is nice, the speed is better than I had anticipated (so far). The hard driver is not huge and an inexpensive external hard drive would make a perfect complement to this purchase.	3	6	3	3	0
They lowered the price right after I bought it. No Matter what they would not refund my $50 back. I could have went with a gift card as well.And about the product. DON'T BUY IT. The battery barely runs for 3.5 hours if you use it lightly with better battery mode. On high performance it will die in 2 hour. If you play games it will die in less than an hour and half. Very bad battery. Slow responsive. Pc runs at over 50% for something simple like browsing the net. Wifi gets disconnected for a second in every 30-45 mins. I had search the net like a mad man to fix it, then gave up completely rebooted the new pc. Then it got fixed. Went through extra hassle for that. The customer service just told me to update the drivers, which it was already updates. They don't know anything. Clueless employees. I like the Screen and built quality I guess.I am never buying anything from Amazon ever again.	3	6	3	3	0

There are pros and cons to the latptop.CONS:There really isn't a lot of memory, so I wouldn't recommend saving anything to the hard drive (use an SD card or USB). I had only 6 GB available out of 29 (I'm going to see if there's anything I can clean up or bypass so I can get some additional memory here).Runs slowly (likely due to memory).Does NOT come with MS Office installed. It formerly had it installed but it doesn't have it installed now.PROS:My laptop came in GREAT shape (no dings or anything).I'm a student and MS Office can be utilized online for free though my school, so I don't *HAVE* to download it (but I'm clearing up memory and I'm going to).Overall: I think it'll get the job done. I'm a college student and a busy mom of three. While it's slower than my desktop, I think after a little adjusting, it'll get the job done. It'd be nice if it had more memory and I didn't have to adjust it myself, but you get what you pay for.	0	0	0	1	5
The computer is really nice, just needs a sd card to help it function better. Before or after purchasing buy a sd card to ensure you are able to add music and pics. The wifi picks up incredibly and Cortana is always there to provide help. I highly recommend purchasing this product	0	0	0	1	5
The Stream is a pretty decent laptop for college students running on a tight budget. It's good for casual web surfing, playing media such as videos and music, schoolwork, and can even play some light gaming (League of Legends on extremely low settings). The only drawbacks I found since buying this in August was the storage space and mousepad. The internal memory goes up to 32GB and since it runs on Windows 10 there are updates that will take up the storage pretty quick. Also, the mousepad can be unresponsive and sluggish when moving the mouse around the screen. To solve these issues, you can either buy a microSD card (it can go up to 64GB) and insert it in the small slot on the right side, or delete some factory apps that are pre-installed on the Stream to save space, and buy a mouse (either USB wired/wireless) to make the best out of the Stream. Overall, I found the Stream to be an awesome buy for its price. It's not the best laptop nor a bad laptop but it definitely gets the job done.	0	0	0	1	5
"I purchased this laptop for my daughter because of the size and how it was advertised. She needed a smaller laptop to carry around on campus. It's lightweight and serves the purpose for her needs. It was clean, easy to get started and easy to navigate. Having Windows 10 and Office 2016 already installed was a big plus. My only issue with this laptop is that space seems to be limited on the hard drive. A lot of the space appears to be used by the OS. With every Windows 10 update, more space is consumed. The ""running out of space"" error messages constantly appear. I would think that a 32 gig hard drive is more than enough space. Other than that, it's fast, has good connectivity, good screen resolution and is easy to carry."	0	0	0	1	5
I deal a lot with Laptops, was expecting so much more from this little guy but the processor is absolutely garbage. No matter how many times you run a disc clean up, cc cleaner, etc that won't stop the processor from giving a 100 percent usage all the time. Don't even bother uninstalling apps to speed it up, I removed all the useless apps, but the Processor is always having a hard time, and lags constantly. The worst part is that every 20 minutes the screen has a quick 0.5 second crash! The touch-pad is also terrible, a wireless mouse is needed at all times.	0	0	0	1	5

"It's hard to buy HP Stream Flagship Laptop in such a low price, not to mention that has Intel Celeron Core up to 2.48GHz, 4GB RAM, 32GB SSD which could let me run all kinds of basic programming that I need.

I thought it may just be a random glitch and overlooked it. The slow speed I could not over look then the snow screen became more regular...after not even a week of having it in my possession.

This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!	3	7	3	8	4
I loved it! I'm using it for Video editing, Auto cad, Photoshop, playing online games, watching UHD movies and internet browsing!For me it's fast! and the shipping as well! didn't expected it to be so fast. Well packaged, it came to me safe and sound!Overall, I'm so happy with it and the service! Thanks so much!	3	7	3	8	4
I bought this as an upgrade replacement to a seven year-old Acer laptop and I'm not disappointed. The amount of manufacturer-install cruft was minimal - I had all the sales junk uninstalled in under an hour - and the SSD drive means it boots in seconds.My only complaints are that A. they made some questionable choices about the keyboard layout (the DEL / HOME / END combo got moved around to make way for a POWER button? Why on Earth?) and B. the exact same model is available for $400 from Acer's website minus the SSD, which is < $100 here on Amazon. So I ended up paying a $100 premium to have someone else to do the SSD drive and Windows install for me. I'm not overly broken up about that.	3	7	3	8	4
Pros- Overall pretty fast performance mode is about 3.5 GHZRuns games smoothlyCONs the battery drains insanely fast.Will sometimes lag too much for an i7	3	7	3	8	4
I bought two of these to replace some aged laptops. I was worried because of price and there not my normal vendor. I have to say I love these laptops. I replaced the spinning rust with and SSD from my old laptops to save money. Reinstalled Windows and away we go. I have to say I like the touch pad on these more than my Macbook Pro. Normally I hate touch pads but I used it to setup the laptop. The real test if the wife and kids would like them. I keep checking in with them to see what they think and they said they like or love them as well. My daughter is like I can play all my games on max settings which the old one couldn't do. I have to give ACER a big thumbs up because my family really enjoys these laptops.	3	7	3	8	4
This laptop is a reasonable price but its still not worth it. I should have sent it back right from the start but thought I would hang in there with it. I am on a 400 mps wifi with a router that supports up to 600 and I am barely squeaking out 120 in the same room as the router. All other laptops (HP) have no issues reaching over 300. It is extremely slow and half the time will not process links even with pop up blocker off. Buy a better machine, I wish I did.	3	7	3	8	4
It was running slow when I received it. I had to set windows up to store everything but the system on the second hard drive, and it slowed down even more. Once I formatted the 1tb hard drive and reinstalled windows it has been running like a champ. It boots in about 15 seconds from completely shut off, and it runs fast. It is upgradeable to Solid State Hard drives all around, so I will probably upgrade the hard drives in this computer.	3	7	3	8	4
Very timely shipping, received in great shape and worked right out of the box with no issues to report.wife was thrilled with her new laptop. Definitely would buy another one if I needed to.	3	7	3	8	4
Works great and is fast. I would buy again.	3	7	3	8	4
I bought this strictly as a Sims 3 & 4 gaming laptop. It is perfect for both games with over 30GB of CC and Mods used, HQ settings on both games with no lag at all.	3	7	3	8	4
love this one, quick and truly the most bang for your buck	3	7	3	8	4
Laptop arrived, and is fast. I play Sims 4, City Skylines on it. They run fine in highest settings. It's a good deal.	3	7	3	8	4
I have onlly had this a month but I love it.. It is smooth and very fast and the screen is fantastic. I would tell anyone shopping for something like this to go for this one.. Priced right and has all the credentials of a great laptop.	3	7	3	8	4

Great vendor, terrible laptop. What good is all that CPU and RAM if the hard drive is so slow? It was intolerable - i returned it. I think this would be a great laptop if you wanted to sink another couple hundred for a SSD and void the warranty but I didn’t. Found one with same specs and SSD online elsewhere for just a little more.	3	7	3	8	4
I had some issues when it came out of the box. It isn't updated to the latest windows so it needs to be updated	3	7	3	8	4
Package came on time due to being a prime member. Package was neat. Laptop is terrible. Turned it on and plugged it in and had to wait 3.5 hours for it to update. Used it for about an hour or so after waiting Hours for it to be done updating, BOOM, mouse pad stopped working. Horrible horrible	3	7	3	8	4
This laptop seems to work fine, usually powers up fast, was relatively easy to setup and use, and generally just works. It does NOT come with a CD/DVD drive, so expect to spend another $20-50 for a plug in variety if you need one. This laptop does come with a lot of bloatware and I am still working to remove the non-essentials. Overall it feels a little on the cheap (flimsy side) relative to an HP laptop I have at the office, but for light use at home and as a back up to my almost new Dell all-in-one with a dead motherboard, it's fine. Packaging was very poor. There was very little material to cushion the laptop box so it knocked around a lot inside the shipping box, and the shipping box arrived damaged. It appears the laptop was undamaged, but I am a little worried that something will show up later.	3	7	3	8	4
This is a nice machine. It is speedy and has good display. I would have appreciated a user manual already loaded on disk but I had to hunt for one on the Acer website. The trackpad seems over sensitive but I haven't looked for an adjustment within Windows.Overall, I recommend this PC.BTW, it came on time and was well packaged.	3	7	3	8	4
husband very satisfied with laptop	3	7	3	8	4
I ordered two LaptopsLaptops are ok butI'm not sure that is brand new because the secure sticker on box was broken on both laptops.	3	7	3	8	4
The keyboard doesnt light up and i dont like that	3	7	3	8	4
The perfect laptop.	3	7	3	8	4
Its a pretty good laptop so far. Reloading (to get rid of the Bloat...) seems to take a really long time but that is windows and not a hit on the laptop. So far its nice for the price....and the DVD...its real not fake....so who ever said that was full of it.	3	7	3	8	4
Easy to operate.	3	7	3	8	4
The laptop can run small programs like chrome, YouTube, Netflix, etc. But it can not run big games. Mine doesn't even lock when I close the screen and the fan can be very loud and it sounds like the radioactive detecting sound. I would not recommend because the graphics card is what kills the performance and so does the bad motherboard.	3	7	3	8	4
The computer, the speed is great. But I despise windows 10. Also, I have returned it because it advertises a CD/DVD writer, but it not only does not have a writer, but does not come with a DVD or CD player. I have a ton of software that I have to load onto it, that comes with CDs/DVDs so after spending days setting it up with my preferences, I begin to install software only to learn that I don't have a DVD/CD rom. Also, Windows 10 forces you to create an account to log in with. It is annoying.	3	7	3	8	4
Do not buy this computer. Hours spent trying to update windows 10 and still not fixed. Between Acer and Microsoft this has been a huge waste of time. Customer support for both have been incompetent.	3	7	3	8	4
I ordered this laptop and noticed it was running slower than it should, so I had a certified and licensed technician check it out. Turns out, the motherboard was bad, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement which couldn’t be done, they could only send me a refund and I could reorder. By the time everything was done, I had my refund, and I was ready to reorder, the price for the laptop had gone up by $30. I called customer service and asked if there was anything that could be done since it was a problem that came right out of the manufacturer, and because I really did want this laptop, they said no because it’s being sold by a third party and there is no way for me to speak to the manufacturer directly as I have checked. Upon further inspection, this isn’t even the same laptop that I had originally ordered. The specs have been slightly altered, there is no longer a SSD in this laptop, and it’s overall just lower quality than the laptop I wanted. So, in the end, I regret ever even considering spending money on this laptop and you shouldn’t either.	3	7	3	8	4
It came, and the laptop runs great, but the thing on the side that looks like a cd rom is not. Its a dummy.	3	7	3	8	4
Was easy to set up, especially for a tech-challenged old man. I was expecting a half-inch thick instruction book but it's all done interactively. You power it up and follow the prompts. It took a half day to load everything; you have to be patient. It serves all my needs, shopping banking, etc. I don't do games or movies on it so I can't comment on its capabilities there. The default browser is Microsoft Edge; I managed to change it to IE11 which is easier for me. For the money, you can't go wrong. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.	3	0	0	8	5
If I could give something NO STARS I would’ve. Worst laptop I’ve seen since the 90’s. Slow to load . Non responsive, everything you do NOT WANT in a laptop. And by the way ITS NOT RED ITS ORANGE. Go find something else if you read this review.	3	0	0	8	5
Laptop sucks. Updates and loads extra slow. It took 22 hours for my laptop to download and install all windows updates. Laptop never connects to my wifi and my laptop battery drains faster than it should because it's trying so hard to connect to the wifi. It will connect for a minute and disconnect but it will show that it's still connected to my wifi. I bought an Ethernet cable but I don't want an Ethernet cable to my laptop. I should've just got a desktop computer I guess. The point of a laptop is to take it around with you, not sitting on your desk hooked to an Ethernet cable because it can't connect to WiFi. I've had this laptop for about two weeks and I've only used it once because it was hooked to an Ethernet cable. Other times I've tried it without the Ethernet cable and it doesn't work. Waste of money if you ask me.	3	0	0	8	5
I am a student who purchased this Ideapad to use specifically for paper writing and research for school. I did not have really high expectations about browsing speed etc. Alas though, I have had it for maybe a month and during this time it has frozen at least weekly to the point of manual restart, it connects/disconnects to the internet constantly making research take so much longer than it should as I have to constantly refresh the pages until it decides it wants to connect. I know the problem is not my internet as my phone and ipad remain connected.	3	0	0	8	5

This was a replacement for another Chromebook so the performance was as expected eg. excellent. What pleasantly surprised me , because I hadn't given it any thought , was that all my sites were there complete with remembered passwords. Chromebooks are the best buy for the buck.	3	1	0	0	5
i have had about 4 laptops int he past 10 years -after my last one i decided to get a chromebook simply because i do not like windowsi got this today and really expected to spend the night trying to figure this out-much to my surprise it took me less than 2 minutes to get it set up and running it doesnt take long to power up and get online like my hp and i love it only problem i wouldsay is it has no dvd drive but i am ok with that i wanted a basic computer that is simple to use and i got one -couldnt be happier	3	1	0	0	5

"I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them ""programs"" and ""software"") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews.Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6"" HD ""Premium Chromebook"" is not really ""premium."" For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10"" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15"" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to ""trade-up"" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15"" Chromebook as a spare at the office.My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it.The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be ""HD,"" but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10"" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15"" screen a 7/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing.The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them.The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle.Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a ""premium"" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger.In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities.UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model."	3	1	0	0	5
I purchased this for my wife to use in the Master's program she has started. She was frustrated by our old computer, and this works like a breeze. The Chromebook OS lets her have immediate start-up, while our Office 365 account allows her to use a full host of Microsoft products online, if she needs something outside the Google products. She had been extremely pleased and wished she would have purchased a Chromebook years ago.	3	1	0	0	5
I bought these, specifically, for my 4 kids whom I homeschool. I didn't want anything outlandishly expensive; just very basic. Something they can do their schoolwork on, typing courses, etc. This computer totally fits the bill. The screen is big, the keyboard is great, and even though it doesn't have too many bells and whistles, this is perfect for our needs. And the price?! YOU BETCHA. Totally satisfied with our purchase.	3	1	0	0	5
I wanted to get a laptop for my stepdad because his was infected with so many different things that it didn't work properly anymore. So, when I saw this I couldn't believe my luck at the amazing price! I got it in the mail yesterday and set it up for him so it would be ready when he got home from work. It runs so smooth;y that I couldn't believe it! It answers commands immediately, the display color is fantastic, it has great speakers, he can use a regular mouse on it, and SO many other things! I'm EXTREMELY happy with this purchase, and my stepdad was even happier. THANKS GUYS!	3	1	0	0	5
Great deal - Great Chromebook! Arrived today and booted up instantly with great performance. I was up and running in minutes. For the price its perfect for my school classes and budget. The display is HUGE and clear for my needs. Its a NON-GLOSS display and perfect for all the basics. Good keyboard and soft touch keys. It also has plenty of room to rest your palm so thats nice but I always use an external mouse. I never had a Chromebook and was surprised there is NO Delete Key. I looked over and over and NO delete key. I find that when you Right Click you can delete stuff. I thought it was listed as Black its really a Dark Charcoal Grey which I love even more! Professional packing and all.	3	1	0	0	5
"Excellent Alternative to Windows PCs...FINALLY!!! New, this is around $300, mine is ""Refurbished"" for $188. And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS. One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative). No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans! Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser. Google provides lifetime Free Virus Protection, An Entire Suite of Office Apps called Google Docs (no Outlook or MS Works needed...YAY!) plus Hundreds more Apps at No Charge! Try it, You'll Like it."	3	1	0	0	5
So far, very happy with this Chromebook. For my daughter, for college. Very different than a Windows-based computer, but not too hard to figure out (And there is LOTS off online help and tutorials!) Would certainly recommend!	3	1	0	0	5
Refurbished, really.Can't tell, looks great, sounds great and works perfect. I have to admit this is my first Chrome book, alittle different. Not like my android phone and not like my Microsoft Surface, so there will be a learning curve. So far so good.Update: damm, the price went $50.00. Goto walmart you can get a brand new one for $179.00	3	1	0	0	5
My girlfriend loves it! Big screen, decent speakers on the sides, USB ports, easy to use, great price. Only con is the touchpad isn't the greatest, but with all the pros this Chromebook has, can't even complain that much.	3	1	0	0	5
As a student, im not exactly rolling in money but needed a laptop for school so a Chromebook was a given. This product shipped on time, had no visible scratches and the cheapest i have found and has had no problems in these first few weeks. The only thing thats not quite as good as i wanted (given the price isn't a big deal at all) is just the track pad is a bit finicky. all being said is a solid product and i wasn't even able to tell it was refurbished.	3	1	0	0	5
I bought my first Acer Chromebook several years ago and loved it. I thought that I'd try another one but a larger one when the keyboard on my older, smaller model wore out (keys just stopped working). So I bought this. It's just ok. The battery life is good but I expected it to work faster than it does because it's supposed to have a faster processor speed. Occasionally, the machine slows down to a crawl and I'm not sure why. My biggest concerns: the quality of the machine and the price. There is a line that runs across the screen. I didn't notice it at first but there's a line that runs from one side of the screen to the other. It's more noticeable with the machine off than on but it upsets me that a refurbished unit would have the line. The other thing is that the overall feel of the machine is one of cheapness. My older machine was a solid little thing -- the new machine feels cheap. When I open the machine, the plastic creaks like it's not stuck together (glued? screwed?) properly. I also purchased the machine for a reasonable price then in the greatest Amazon tradition, the price dropped significantly. I requested a price match but was denied since the machine I bought came from one seller and the same machine for the less expensive price was from a different seller. I would not buy this machine again but would look for something different. Although the battery life seems better than my older, smaller machine, that's the only positive thing I see with this machine.	3	1	0	0	5

I didn't have a problem with this machine until right after the 30 day return window expired. I have been having technical issues shortly after. I would get black lines running across my screen, the machine would freeze. I would have to do a reboot. I then received a message to reinstall the operating system. I was able to do that successfully. Once I did that, I did a powerwash just in case. My machine was once again functional...for about 3 hours. Since that time, this has happened a total of 5 times. I've even contacted technical support (ACER)...they were able to help me get up and running the second time, but it still keeps happening. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a product seller. I will not buy an ACER product ever again due to this experience and have bought Chromebooks from other manufacturers as gifts and they are still up and running for years.	3	1	0	0	5

"I purchased this for a friend and now I'm jealous. I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself if I could get one equipped with a much larger hard drive. I currently use the Chrome browser in my Windows 10 laptop. It's super quick and a lot more reliable.Update: 2 weeks later. Still running like a champ. My friend went to this from a 7"" tablet because, well, we're all getting older and the eyes don't see as good as before. Bigger screen, easy to see. This is more or less a large tablet with a keyboard. I like the fact that we didn't need to get any security software to protect it, Google seems to have that under control"	3	1	0	0	5
I was in the market for a Chromebook to do my school work on as an educator and not break my pocketbook purchasing it. This one fit the bill. So far so good. I have been using it daily, numerous times a day for over a month now. It is a great laptop for my educational classroom needs.	3	1	0	0	5

This is a good computer for what it is, and what it is is a Chromebook. That means it is a laptop running Google’s Chrome OS. The operating system is fast and very user friendly.One thing that people will complain about is the amount of space that the laptop comes with. It’s about 15gb. Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you don’t need to (or more accurately, can’t) download programs. That being said, don’t expect to be downloading games and movies.The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. I’ll explain later)The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when it’s not skipping frames.With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection.If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu. I won’t get into that, just simply explain that it’s possible.For your money, it is a good machine and I actually enjoy using it.	3	1	0	0	5
I give this 5 stars.First, it's only very inexpensive computer. But what you get in screen size and keyboard is very good for the money. I bought this for my church to do QuickBooks Online software. It looks like this was a wise decision since we do not need any onboard storage (computer has some though). I am impressed with the speed and screen brightness. I have watched movies and videos online without problems.I think I may buy one for my family to use. It is solid and does not have any loose or poorly fitting parts, but it is not as solidly built as a MacBook, but what can you expect for 1/5 fo the price. It is well worth the money I spent. If you have a kid or an older parent this should be a great computer for them because no Windows updates or virus software to fight or confuse the user. Be aware it is Google-centric and takes a google account to fully access all features.I have not tried games or anything like that on the computer but I am impressed with the machine compared to my daughter's Chromebook computer (3-4 years old), it's much snappier and the screen is much better in brightness and clarity.	3	1	0	0	5
the laptop or Chromebook I got it is old. this is not new, and also it has scratches and gaps in top of the notebook. I am really sad because it had good comments in the reviews. I am not able to return it because I do not have enough time. I will travel out of the country, but you will be careful because we are paying for good stuff.	3	1	0	0	5
My kids took over my other computers, so I decided to get one of my own. I enjoy the convenience of having a personal computer where all my passwords are mine, etc. This computer is sometimes a little slow, which was disappointing. But I suppose that it what I get with a dual-core. It doesn't have any other issues. I use it for email, social media, google docs and spreadsheets, calendar, YouTube, online shopping, and the like. I don't use it for gaming or music, so I can't say how it would do for that. It holds a charge very well!	3	1	0	0	5

It came packaged with bubble wrap and a secure box! Everything works on it and it did come with a charging cord 😊	3	1	0	0	5
So far so good. I've had several Acer desk tops and have been very pleased with them.(My only misstep was the Acer Aspire 'All-in-One'. Nice computer but very limited to add-on resources.)This laptop is pretty new and have not used it a whole lot at this point.I added a $90.00 Crucial 8 GB memory (Now at 16 w. 32 capacity) - easy install and it works fine. I'm not putting a heavy load on the system or gaming - so it suits my needs as expected.I have a Acer desktop that is my primary computer. (the laptop is basically a 'fail safe') - but, with the added mobility and comparatively small footprint.Looks nice - keyboard feels solid. A little clumsy opening the cover - maybe because it is so new. (A bit stiff.) But that's not a big issue.Full HD images seem a little washed out - until you get the screen in just the right position.	3	1	0	0	5
This was my first time making a computer purchase on Amazon. Wasnt a big deal since it was for my kids to do homework and with such a reasonable price i figured why not. I was soooo amazed once I opened the package. The computer was refurbished but it looked brand spaking new to me! I the screen was nice and wide. I seriously wanted to give my children my laptop and keep this 1.This is definitely worth the buy! my daughter is headed to college an i will be making a purchase again to present as a graduation gift. Its not heavy or bulky, again its a great screen size and resolution, everything works as expected! Im really impressed and did i mention the price....very much worth it!	3	1	0	0	5

This is my first chromebook and although I am still confused at how to get it to do some things that I've always done on Windows PC, I am impressed. This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I like that it turns on automatically when I open it. The packaging was plain but very secure and my laptop came without a scatch! I saw some others say they hadn't gotten a charging cable but I think they just missed it. You have to dig all the way to the bottom of the box, where there is smaller piece of cardboard separating the charging cable from the rest of the packaging. I almost missed it myself and was worried I would have to return. Overall, I really like it even though I'm new to chromebook.	3	1	0	0	5

The laptop is EXTREMELY fast, much better than I anticipated. I use it to do homework while watching TV, instead of using our desktop. It's a chromebook, but I search the internet faster than prior gaming laptops I've owned. The machine runs like a champ. This was one of the best purchases I've made in the past couple of years. You usually get what you pay for, but this is a bargain and a great machine.	3	1	0	0	5

I was looking for something lightweight and fast. This is both of those. Going from a Windows OS to the Chrome OS was something I wasn't sure about. I've always used Windows, but I bought my 81 year old mom a Chromebook for Christmas, and she loves it. I figured if she can figure it out, I can too. Setup is simple and straightforward, just log into your Google account, if you have one. If not, you can create one.. I bought a flash drive for pics and files. I added my VPN, that setup was simple too. The price can't be beat, the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified. I'd definitely recommend this	3	1	0	0	5
It was a gift, they are very happy with their Acer... I though It was a regular laptop but it was what they call a tablet??? as long as they are happy I am happy!	3	1	0	0	5
I purchased two of these for my girls. They were perfect for the use they'll receive. Educational apps, learning how to navigate a computer, and of course YouTube and Netflix. The price was very competitive, especially considering that I was looking to purchase two. The delivery was also much faster than anticipated. Thanks seller, the girls loved them!	3	1	0	0	5
First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed! Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself....it's a powerful laptop for a Chromebook I've run multiple pages in HD videos streaming with very minimal lag (due to area of internet). But what I love the most is the charger which is very important as to how long ur laptop will last, not only is it super fast at charging but it is delicate and easy to plug in and it pops off as a safety mechanism I believe...either way it never overheats it charges really fast even during heavy use and it has options to really dim down the screen to save energy. It's like a tablet but you can do way more and run apps with easy... A must have if you like to entertain your family or others as the speakers on this babe are crisp and clear. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone/iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs. So get one for sure and forget about charging ur phone and looking like a boy who can out down his Gameboy lol jk	3	1	0	0	5
"Love it. It runs fast, I can watch YouTube/Netflix no problem, the sound is decent, the screen is really big and it's easy to use. No caps key, but I quickly trained myself to hold shift down for a capital letter when necessary, which is often because I use this primarily for my online college classes. Does everything. Had an issue accessing a few web pages at first due to ""privacy issues"" but the problem fixed itself. Haven't met a webpage I cant load. Highly recommend."	3	1	0	0	5
"I bought this to replace a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit. This Acer is much bigger with its 15.6"" screen. Right out of the box, as usual the setup was almost instant, and I love the feel of the keyboard. I saw a sticker saying to open from both ends to find cord, and it is hard to notice when you're excited to get the chromebook out of its packing. Don't throw the cord away! It was packed very well.So far I love it, and will update if I find it isn't what I thought, but I bought it for the price, size, and the fact that it was a Chromebook. Very impressed with the quality so far!"	3	1	0	0	5

My first and probably last chromebook.1) Computer arrived in pretty much brand new looking finished. I easily could have mistook this for a new computer, except that it was still configured as a meeting chromebox and required Acer tech support troubleshoot the issue with me for an hour before being able to login to the computer.2) OS update allows me to use android apps on the computer. However, the two apps I use most crash every time i open them. So I'm back to accessing on them on the browser. I like my apps better, but apps don't work on this thing, despite what the OS description said. If you want to access an app or service, its done through your Chrome browser, not the androidapp.3) My biggest complaint about this computer is the keyboard. The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key. Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position. Its extremely cumbersome using the keyboard despite its full size. Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it. If that search button wasnt in such a stupidly designed location, this would be a 3 star review.The main redeeming value of this computer, and only reason its not a 1 star review is the ease of use in terms of the Chrome OS. If you know chrome, you already know the computer. It would have been nice if the seller would have set the puter back to factory stats prior to mailing it. 1 hour of my life wasted troubleshooting that little mix up.	3	1	0	0	5
This is my first laptop/Chromebook. I am everything Google, so this works out perfectly! I use a desktop computer and my cell ph mostly, but needed something for downstairs which this works great. It came fully refurbished, clean. Their is 2 scratch marks barely noticeable on the casing, but other than that and for the price of under $150.00 I feel I got an awesome deal.	3	1	0	0	5
My daughter recently change schools and at their old school they needed Apple but at her new school she's used Chromebook. To get a Chromebook at this price is so worth it she is so excited and has no problem navigating through different websites. I'm absolutely buying another one for my sons. The seller was super nice and sent me an e-mail asking to rate the chrome book and if I have any problems email him which I thought it was very kind.	3	1	0	0	5
I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it.It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it. I never thought about buying Refurbished, but now I'm sorry that I didn't do it before. I bought a new laptop at Best Buy and could have gotten a much better one that was refurbished for the price that I paid. Go REFURBISHED	3	1	0	0	5
This machine looks and performs flawlessly!I bought it for my father and he finally has a portable computing device for all his ?? Computing requirements! He had an old Dell desktop that performed slower than molasses in winter after his 8 years of email etc... he finally upgraded and LOVES this machine. I haven’t gotten a “tech support” call in weeks👍	3	1	0	0	5
Extremely happy. It is light weight, very fast and has a long life battery. Well worth every penny and I was thinking about getting another because it is so portable. It does not have a dvd/cd player but for the price you can buy an external one.	3	1	0	0	5
"Purchased for my son. Others had more features, but my son wanted a large screen and he was initially very happy. EXCEPT he says space bar does not work well. I wish he had let me buy him one with more RAM, more GB, SSDL --there were several available with a bit smaller screen. Had we gotten one of those, he would probably be happier. He recently told me, ""A smaller screen would be ok."" Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is too late for an exchange. I would be thrilled to purchase him a better one!"	3	1	0	0	5
This laptop is NICE !Purchased this for my 9yr old son. Im honestly a bit jealous lol . Anyways it was delivered on it's given date, and today we went through the simple set up. He is very excited to have Google Play Store. Thanks for an awesome laptop !!	3	1	0	0	5
i had this for about 7 months and its still going strong. it hasn't broke down on me yet. i mainly use it to browse the web i don't make youtube videos or do heavy task ect.. so this is perfect for me. and if i want to play a game i go on my consoles and do that. i use to browse on my tablet alot but since i got this bad boy this killed my beloved tablet. if you want a buy a laptop without spending 500-1000 dollars(im looking at you apple!) go for a chromebook and its incredibly fast once you turned it on it only takes less then 3-2 minutes to turned on.	3	1	0	0	5
Excellent price. I know it was refurbished but you wouldn't know it. The package came with a very heavy bubble wrap, which protected the computer. The set up was plug and ready. I love this Chromebook is the best. I have had Asus chrome books and I feel that the Acer is the best. I love the large screen. I love it so much that I ordered another one for my husband. I would recommend this Acer to everyone. Easy to operate and fast. Also, don't forget that it has its own Antivirus build right in the computer.	3	1	0	0	5

"Bought this for my in-laws when their Windows laptop stopped working. Keeping the old laptop updated and virus/malware free was proving to be a challenge for them. They absolutely love the simplicity of this Chromebook. Getting a 15.6"" at this price is a steal. Highly recommend for anyone who just needs a worry free machine to browse the internet."	3	1	0	0	5
For what I bought it for, it serves its purpose perfectly. I am very happy after using it for a week now. We had a Macbook Air and one of my humans spilled water on it. Game over. Couldn't afford another one so after doing some research this is a perfect band aid for a little picture management and Netflix watching. My daughter uses a Chromebook for her class so this was also a plus. Very budget friendly and we have a laptop again in the household.Update: About 2 weeks into computer , the charger went out. Charger would not charge computer. Uuuugh. Seller had no replacement for it. Remember this is a refurbished item. Be careful. Bought a new charger and is back to good. So computer works great, the process was the bummer.	3	1	0	0	5
I'm very happy with my purchase. The laptop came quickly and was well packaged. I was looking for straightforward laptop that wouldn't break the bank. Did some research on chromebooks and found they fit my needs (basic web surfing, simple documents). Went with this one because it hit all my marks. Setup was quick and easy, and the laptop has been everything I needed. Very happy with my purchase!	3	1	0	0	5

"It's OK--I was disappointed that after just a few months the action on the touchpad would deteriorate to the point where we can't use it to scroll down anymore on the screen and have to use the arrow keys--the action was always a little ""sticky"" from the get-go but now, it's even worse. I get that this is second hand, but I was hoping for the mechanics to survive longer--luckily we can switch to a mouse--"	3	1	0	0	5

"One week in with the new chromebook and so far, so good! I bought the chromebook for a job that required me to have my own laptop. I wanted something lightweight to carry around. But most importantly I was looking to spend a little money as possible. The value for this is great! The 15.6"" screen was a must for me since I will be doing so much work.

"Ordered it on the 17th and received it on the 22nd (once again 2 day shipping is non existent from Amazon).Setting it up now, so far so good.. first thing I noticed is this black refurbished Chromebook with the steel colored lid came with a white cord. (why?). My other Chromebook (Acer) died that I bought in 2016. I've been using an older Acer Chromebook I bought many yrs ago, small but has never given me a problem. Bought this one to use while waiting for a new hard drive on my newer Acer (bought in 2016)that's always been unstable and just died.So far this one seems nice.. i will update my review as time goes on since i just received it today. I haven't tried the speakers or the battery life yet.. I'll update this in a month or so after i see how everything works out, but for a refurbished product, right out of the box, i'm satisfied so far.Next day: This refurbished chromebook is supposed to have at least 7 hrs battery life. i""m happy to say I used it 9.5 hrs unplugged and the meter said I had almost 4 hours left of battery use. We'll see how that works out in the months to come.1/24 Battery continues to have long life but the meter is very irregular. One minute it says i have 7 hrs and 30 mins left, an hour later it says i have 10 hrs and 40 mins left, an hour later it says I have 8 hrs and 20 mins left - either way, so far, it is long (enough) battery life.*I'm not really happy with the lack of depth of color on this chromebook - it's supposed to be non-glare and that may be contributing to the issue i have with the lack of color.. there is no enhancer (1 app avail and does nothing) and these chromebooks have no settings for color.. this particular book, the color doesn't pop, has no depth.. very disappointing compared to my other 2 chromebooks.* Speakers are just ok - nothing to write home about but they do the basic job. My biggest issue with this chromebook is the lack of color depth."	3	1	0	0	5
Laptop came on time and (mostly) works as expected. There is a key on the keyboard (the apostrophe key) that works only on the second click which is odd.

Exactly what I needed. I use a laptop for online work and my last one died on me. This is my first chromebook. I had went out and bought an 11 inch Chromebook from the store, came home and was disappointed by the screen size. Returned it and started looking on Amazon. Found this one for the same price as the 11 inch one so I was thrilled. I knew I needed a bigger screen. It seriously looks brand new and was packaged very well. Very fast for surfing which is basically all I need it for. My daughter likes to play online games on it as well. Super happy with it so far.	3	1	0	0	5
This laptop might be good for younger tech savvy people but for old people like me that just want a laptop to do their work and browse the internet, it is not for them. Everything is completely different about this thing and it is like relearning how to use a computer completely from scratch or worse actually. I tried to download pictures from an sd card and that was a complete nightmare. It was worse than slow. It would have taken atleast week to download 500 pics. This purchase was a complete mistake. I tried to give it a chance and figure it out but after a few days of almost zero progress and endless frustration I returned it.	3	1	0	0	5

As this item was purchased as a gift, I didn't try it out myself beyond ensuring that it started up. It seems to be nicely suited to the tasks intended: email, some web browsing and maybe some kindle/video watching. It is light-weight enough to not encumber and the screen is large enough to view without undue strain or feeling a truncated sense of image.I don't know how it fares with travel conditions, nor how well it connects/streams data from sources other than home base at this time, but I have no reason to doubt that it will function as was described.The keyboard takes a little adjustment, as any would, for those coming from primarily desktop or smartphone input types, but it is still easier to utilize for arthritic hands than a tablet or phone pad.	3	1	0	0	5

It was bigger than I thought which is great. This is the second chromebook I have so I wasn't amazed by all the features, but they WERE satisfactory. The speakers also work really well compared to my other chromebook. The packaging is probably what amazed me.....it came in a HUGE box that contained another box which contained a plastic bubble wrap thing that protected the chromebook. If I could buy this for someone as a present, I would. Overall, I like the chromebook and there isn't really anything that disappointed me. Also the chromebook is WAYYYY heavier than I expected.	3	1	0	0	5

The screen is big... but not really HD by any means. I am actually returning it because oddly enough, it feels like the keyboard is much smaller than a normal keyboard so I keep missing keys and have to spend time thinking about how to type on the smaller keyboard which is annoying. It could just be that the keys are tightly spaced and don't have any gaps like the other keyboards I've been used to typing on..	3	1	0	0	5

"I was skeptical, due to the fact that this computer costs less than 250. My mindset was of the idea of ""You get what you pay for.""Well, color me surprised because I am blown away by this spicy Chromebook. It gives you the real estate of a full sized computer, with the speed and reliability of a Chromebook. It does better than my Asus laptop,with every advantage on paper. The battery is a hard A+ and these units show that Chromebooks have come a long way and have applications that prevent you from having to settle.I highly recommend it."	3	1	0	0	5
I bought one of these refurbished and it completely died after only 4 months of light use. I've emailed Acer twice now because it's still under warranty and no response.

The battery life is crazy, it really goes all day. But it's lacking in processing power and the resolution takes a little to get used to. Webpages act a little strange, the headers sometimes take up massive chunks of the screen even when you scroll down. But it works well enough and you can do homework all day and hate your life while being productive. So that's...nice?	3	1	0	0	5

This was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law. The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish (no scratches or markings) and seemed to work well for about the first month and then she started having problems with two of the keys on the keyboard sticking. It doesn't make it unusable, it's just frustrating to her, otherwise I would have given it five stars.	3	1	0	0	5

The laptop came in good condition (as expected because it was refurbished). But the charger was defective. I plugged it in and the charging light wouldn’t show. I called Acer support line and they said either the laptop or the charger might be defective. However, I went to Best Buy and purchased a new charger because I needed to use the laptop immediately. Now, the laptop is working perfectly and the new charger is great. The photo below shows the defective charger (in white) and the functional charger I purchased (in black).	3	1	0	0	5
I have not used the computer yet, so this review is strictly based upon my disappointment upon receipt of product. Although description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included, there is no power source cord included! I reached out to Amazon immediately and they offered a gift card for the cost to purchase one. However, I feel I should warn others about this scenario as it appears I am mot the first customer to experience this problem. After receiving the item, I read the questions asked area and see that others were just as frustrated as myself due to the lack of power source. The computer is meant to be a gift for my nephew and was requested specifically by him via Amazon link. My lesson learned... although a requested gift; READ EVERYTHING before purchase.	3	1	0	0	5

First off, I read all the reviews. Some were good, some were bad. I thought that there were more good then bad so I decided to buy this. WORST MISTAKE EVER! The camera is busted. The “refurbished” is broken. They didn’t fix it right. I contacted the seller, and as you can guess, IM STUCK WITH THIS AND NOW HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW LAPTOP. People don’t care about warranties on their products	3	1	0	0	5

I bought this for my children to use for their internet-based homework. I haven’t been able to turn it on yet because it did NOT include a power cord.

This is my first time purchasing a refurbished product and will probably be my last.	3	1	0	0	5

It was a great and beautiful computer. It worked awesome, was so excited when I opened it. But unfortunately I made a mistake and didn't realize that it had wrong OS for what I needed.

It's fine for work and light browsing of the internet. However, it is incredibly slow and often freezes when multiple tabs or open or you're watching Youtube or Netflix videos. Also chromebook is not the best OS as you cannot download certain things such as Steam, and it basically requires you to use Chrome or else it's useless.	3	1	0	0	5

I purchased this Chromebook for online classes primarily. I already utilized google apps and programs prior when I had an android phone. You can't download any kind of software or anything to it, which is why there's so little space on the hard drive. It's not necessary. You do get up to 100GB of storage space on your google drive for a year or two though. For school purposes, I use Office Online since I can't download the actual software to the computer, and it works pretty much just the same. I also use it for facebook, email, shopping, etc.. It can definitely be a tiny bit slow if you're trying to look at a ton of stuff at once. I had to disable the autoplay on my facebook so it doesn't play the videos automatically and slow it down. But all in all, this does exactly what I purchased it for. I have a regular laptop if I need any additional processing power or storage space.The laptop may be refurbished, but it came in perfect condition. No scratches or dents, and no issues with the way it runs at all.	3	1	0	0	5

"Wow, after 30+ years in the IT development and support industry, I found building a Linux kernel, and building a laptop from scratch easier than figuring out how to set a passphrase in Chrome. The Chrome help is a nightmare, and I think operating system and general google changes invalidates most of the advice that one can find online. I am pretty frustrated. Sound worked out of the box, but then, by waving my hand or something, it stopped working. Also sync won't work, and I can find no way to put in a ""passhrase"". All the ""helps"" are not helpful, because the Icons, words or whatever ""they"" say to click on, AREN' THERE! (software changes?)Unless you have more patience than Job, or nothing else to do for a month or so. don't try a chromebook."	3	1	0	0	5

We purchased 3 of these for our company and couldn't be happier. We have a web based training program for some of our employees and these fit the bill perfectly.

I figured for $200 it wouldn’t be great but what I didn’t predict was it barely works. Drops internet during any download, can only store 1 movie and the drive becomes “critically low” and most web pages stutter. This includes trying to use google documents which means typing a page stutters so much it’s not possible to use. I returned after a couple days.	3	1	0	0	5

Nice chromebook does surfing, bills ect in snap and the bigger monitor is a +. My biggest complaint is the weight it feels like a regular laptop with all the hardware and the micro SD card doesn't insert all the way only half so you don't really want to. Store it with the card. Other than that it's working good for the price it's a nice addition to my electronics.	3	1	0	0	5

Chromebook is good for kids but, if you're a person that does a lot more than just surf the net, it'll drive you crazy. It has nothing that it should (basic network printing options, Adobe, etc.). It's a cool concept, a pretty fast as far as laptops go. But not for the 35 & up crowd	3	1	0	0	5

My previous Chrome book was an HP and a little smaller, but so much faster. This one boasted being fast, but it lags quite a bit. I checked my wifi connection and even made sure I had all the updates. This is a nice looking computer, but nice looking does not make it more functional. I am not returning it, but may find some other way to speed it up.	3	1	0	0	5

I particularly like the system because of her affordability but i dislike it because it lacks some feautures which i really need which i was not aware of it before the purchase of it like inbuilt CD drive, and it doesn't come with temporal antivirus. It really sadenned my heart. I dont mind returning for better system and pay more.	3	1	0	0	5
The computer is pretty intuitive but does have some features that I am not used to or should I say don't like, Caps being the main one, I touch type and automatically default to the caps key when capitalizing letters at the being of a sentence, on this model I have to hit the alt and magnifying key at the same time, not sure why they did this but its a pain in the backside so not sure if I will use it that much	3	1	0	0	5

As a browser it works great, but I need it for business, and a chrome book does not let me do what I need to. With limited storage, I would have to use a flash drive for all documents, and I can't save pics. We'll probably gift to our daughter and get something else.	3	1	0	0	5

It was my own fault, but I didn't realize it was a Chrome operating system... too excited to find a computer for $200!!I was disappointed that there was no return of a good machine if it had been opened.

Chrome browser in a box. If that is what you need excellent. Think of the most locked up useless tablet you can find. That tablet is more useful then a chromebook or a chromebox. Get a keyboard and monitor for your smart phone and you get a better system. If it can run in or on a chrome web browser then it probably run on a chromebook. If can not run on a chrome browser then it can not run on a chromebook.	3	1	0	0	5

I've only had it for about 3 weeks. Here are some things I love: The price can't beat it, it didn't even seem Refurbished. The chrome OS does all I need to do, the FAST on/off awesome compared to my windows desktop. unit is very sturdy I don't know what other posters were saying about cheap feeling, The speakers are very good for a laptop let alone at this price. .Here are the things I don't like but none are deal breaker as I was not expecting a 499.00 laptop comparison: The screen is not the best but better then I thought but again not spending 500$. The keyboard a learning curve but after awhile no prob, a bit slow sometimes works fine in youtube, Netflix , periscope forget it, works but just not enough power under the hood. Over all it was/is a great choice for me.	3	1	0	0	5

Exceptional laptop. With that 8th gen Core i5, it's such a pleasure to use this for anything (heck, I was playing a freaking 8K video and a 4K video at the same time and it still wouldn't drop frames), all while battery life is absolutely great. The chassis is sturdy yet very light weight. Really not much to complain about. If you want a lightweight, premium, top performance ultrabook, this is the one to get.My only gripe was that the display seemed to have a bit of green tint, very noticeable when compared to my phone's calibrated display or the Samsung Chromebook Pro I tried for a while, but lowering the Green contrast to 46 from 50 in Intel Graphics settings solved it. I also bumped the saturation just +5, and the screen looks gorgeous now–very similar to my small Pixel 2 which is very well calibrated. Only tip is to uninstall ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement Utility as it doesn't allow Intel Graphics Settings to stay after sleep or reboot for some reason, probably because both have calibration options and conflict with each other.With the display fixed, this thing is 10/10. Fan noise is actually very low or non existent in most tasks. Only when I put it under heavy load (like syncing 12,000 files on Google Backup & Sync) do you hear it and even then it's not annoying. And the touchpad does accidentally trigger 'double tap and drag' when you don't want to a few times, but honestly I usually disable 'double tap to drag' because I rarely drag and when I do, it's more natural to click and drag instead of double tapping.This is a great buy that will last you for a long time given the sturdy chassis and future-proof specs.	2	5	2	3	4
OK I love it. Have had it for three weeks. Lightening fast. 8th gen i5 and 256 SSD. I love the keyboard . Don't understand the complaint that the feel is too light. No problem with shutdown/restart that some people have reported. Still learning Windows 10, up from Windows 7 on old p.c. Would have liked a third USB port since I use a mouse (old school). Speaking of old school, I don't have a screen bleed problem with gaming or watching videos because, well, I don't do that. No ghosting. No buttons popping off keyboard. I have not yet accidentally turned it off because of the location of the power button where the delete button usually is. I am satisfied with the battery life though it is not 12 hours. But I bet I could get there if I spent some time checking what apps run at startup. recharges fast. It's quiet. It is not hot. So far, I have not had any of the problems recorded by the folks who scored this a 1. So take the chance. It's a really fast, very light, easy to use Zenbook if you simply want a good computer.Model: ASUS ZenBook Ultra-Slim Laptop, 13.3-inch Full HD, 8th gen Intel i5-8250U Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Backlit keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, Anti-Glare, Windows 10, Grey, UX330UA-AH55	2	5	2	3	4
Are you on a mid to high end budget? Trying to find a PC that's lightweight and small, without compromising power? Do you care little for 2-1 computers or touch screens? Then this laptop is for you.The specs on this little book are phenomenal. The main selling point for this computer is its 8th Gen Intel i5-8250U processor. The processor is monstrous for this price range. Its base speed of 1.6 GHz, means that your computer will be drawing as little power as possible for low demand tasks like word processing or internet browsing. But its turbo boost up to 3.4 GHz ensures that this laptop has power for more demanding tasks.Oh, and did I mention that this processor has FOUR CORES? Yes, that's right FOUR CORES. This is unusual at this price range, as many laptops on the market around $750 tend to have dual core processors instead. This laptop's processing power rivals, and some cases exceeds others around the $1,000 mark.The PC has enough RAM at 8 GB. Sufficient for most tasks the average consumer will face, and still enough for those looking for an edge. The 256 Solid State Drive provides a reasonable amount of storage. When combined with the processor on this PC, it boots up swiftly.Its battery is more than sufficient for all day use. If you find yourself running low on power, the charger itself is extremely lightweight, and in my experience the laptop is capable of charging around 50% of its battery to near full in about an hour.All of this performance doesn't even take into consideration that this laptop is a lightweight, coming in at 2.6 pounds. As a personal opinion, being able to pick up such a light computer knowing it packs FOUR CORES of power at this price range is an unparalleled high.This laptop is absolutely stellar.	2	5	2	3	4
I've only had this a week, but it's been a great week. I've used this laptop for writing reports, email, web browsing, minor photo editing, and wordpress development. It's worked perfectly for all of those tasks, with no slowdown that I've noticed at any time. Battery life is excellent, with around 10 hours of actual use, and very good standby battery life.The only issues I've had are 1) keyboard - the keys are just a bit . . . different. Sometimes I think that I hit a key, but it doesn't register. This mostly happens when I'm typing longer emails or I'm not paying as much attention. If I focus on my typing, it's not an issue. 2) Fan - the CPU fan comes on even during low intensity tasks like web browsing. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. I wish it were quieter, but it's really not a big deal. For how smooth everything runs, I gladly take the fan noise. And 3) the left USB port doesn't work with my wireless mouse. The right USB port works, and the left USB port works with everything else I've tried, including a USB hub and a thumb drive. Not sure what the issue is there, but I just use the right port.I would definitely buy it again, and I think it's a great device for the price.	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I needed something that was light, sturdy, portable, fast, and good on battery life.Build:This laptop is sturdy with hardly any flex to be found. The exterior of the laptop is metal and looks quite nice. The inside is a premium grade plastic. The laptop is extremely solid when closes and I have no worries throwing it into my backpack. It is extremely light and hardly noticeable on my back. The keyboard is surprisingly nice to use (I had expected it to be bad, but boy was I wrong).Screen: The 13 inch ultrabook screen size is perfect. I used to have a 17 inch display but I do not miss it after having the portability of the 13. I do not have any trouble reading the display. The display gets plenty bright for me in nearly every condition. It is sharp and just all around good looking.Battery: This batter lasts far longer than I ever expected it to. Even on the highest performance settings, I can expect it to last about 4 hours. By turning down the brightness of the keyboard and screen, I can get easily over 9 hours of continuous use of of this thing.Speed: Make sure to get the Intel 8th gen chip. Do not settle for the 7th gen or anything less. The 8th is at least a 40% improvement over the 7 and it shows. This thing is lightning fast. It holds many chrome tabs and programs with ease. I have absolutely no problems with the speed of this device (and I am very picky).Price: Anything cheaper than this will have a significant drop in reliability and build quality. You can get other laptops for cheaper, but I wouldn't. After examining many of its competitors (Dell XPS 13, HP Envy, etc.), I can truly say that this is the best value. Other well known ultrabooks do a fantastic job and may improve slightly over this device, but it will come at a much greater cost.Gaming: Extremely light gaming is doable on this laptop but that is definitely not it's intended purpose. If you expect this to be your main computer as a gamer, you should look elsewhere. Ultrabooks just aren't made for that. You will still need to invest in something with a dedicated graphics card and an i7. I use this laptop when I am away from my gaming desktop.	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop would be great if the monitor wasn't so terrible. I had backlight bleed watching movies no matter how I set the brightness or contrast. Two of these were defective. I sure hope they don't consider this bleeding acceptable. My 6 year old Asus it replaced has darker black and no spill and it was only about 400 dollars. Too bad. This thing loads fast, is light weight, has plenty of power for work and play, but it's just terrible for doing any work with night charts, movies or anything other than surfing web pages. One computer had problems bleeding from the top left corner, bottom right and center. This one has some bleeding from the bottom left and just right of center. It is distracting and annoying. Completely unacceptable in this day and age. Frustrating as all heck. Thankfully, Amazon customer service processed my rant and is taking good care of me.Honestly, I would not purchase an asus product again after this experience. Quality control is extremely important in technology.	2	5	2	3	4
Within a month, the plastic beveling around the screen started to peel off/unattach. I called ASUS support who are the absolute worst. Albeit, all computer customer services are terrible except for Apple. ASUS wanted me to ship back my laptop, at my expense, and wait 4 weeks to get it back. No thanks. Fortunately amazon is letting me return this. Way too dangerous to keep this laptop for the long term and see what other issues arise. Wirecutter needs to update their reviews and remove this cheaply made laptop. Go for Dell XPS 13 insteadBUYER BEWARE	2	5	2	3	4
Everything you would want in a laptop-lightweight-GREAT screen in my opinion (laptops have trouble having good screens)-long lasting battery charge-charges fast-SUPERB KEYBOARD....-Trackpad is just fine for me, others complain but I haven't had a problem. If anything it's great.-wide viewing angle FHD-Thin-Finger print reader-Good SSD (Nothing crazy but just good enough)-I can run SFV / RCT3 (Street Fighter V, 720p/low settings / Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, 1080p nearly maxed settings) both at 60fps+ with the right settings. (Gaming)-great resolution screen, super clear once you set everything up-No real junkware on here, everything like ASUS Hello (gives free dropbox 12 month for 30gbs), sets up your warranty / acc. to ASUS Splendid (screen), that Vivid option is great.-Super good for price (Performance to price ratio)-Has auto brightness, but I turned my option off but it has a sensor for darkness / brightness of the screen-Dual mic for better qualitySometimes I even turn *down* the screen because it's too bright at times. Currently my screen writing this review is on 33%.neutral:-power button is near backspace. I have no problem with it.. I'm too muscle memory to press random buttons but I can see how beginners / non-tech savy / or butterfingers can press it by accidentcon:-Bad webcam. If you need a webcam, buy an external and still get the laptop!! Gladly, I don't use a webcam.Hit me up under this thread if you want to know something specific.	2	5	2	3	4
Very nice ultrabook.Pluses:The startup is fast in about 5-6 secs. The fingerprint scanner is responsive also.SSD performs quite well.Screen is very sharp (not incredibly bright). Not sure what it'd be like in sunlight.Touch pad is very accurate and responsive.Minuses:-No dedicated Insert key (might not be a big deal to most people but for someone who uses Shift-Ins for paste. It's a difficult adjustment to have to hit the Shift-Fn-delete to insert.-The keyboard isn't the best but not bad either. Keys not hit perfectly sometimes lead to missed letters. It's fine for a laptop keyboard though.-Not expandable for memory and SSD	2	5	2	3	4
PROS:1. This is my third Asus - all are still working, just old. I've been pleased with reliability, performance, and battery life on all - and especially this one.2. Very light.3. Fast.4. Good screen size for small laptop.CONS:1. Power button is upper right - where you expact to hit the delete key. (Delete key is to left of it) I had to put a cardboard flap over the power button since every time I went to delete I turned off the PC.2. I like having discrete Home, Page Up/Down, End keys - but it is okay to use CTRL and the arrow keys for that - just took a minute to get used to.OTHER:1. Was a little hard to get used to the keyboard, the keys felt a little far apart - like I needed bigger hands. But after a couple of days, no problems.2. Not a big fan of Windows 10, extra clicks to get most basic tasks done. OneNote does not work properly with it. But that is not Asus' fault.3. I thought the screen was too dim and was a complaint - but then realized that I needed to change the power settings. Now the screen is nice and bright.4. Fan is only loud-ish when doing virus scans or something intensive, otherwise very quiet.	2	5	2	3	4
So far so good.I had a Lenovo Idea laptop for 6 years .It was fanatastic ,never broke down ,but is running slow now.And is so heavy.The Asus is so light 2.6lbs versus 4.7lbs.It boots in seconds,is fast,great picture on screen.If it holds up im going to really like it.Some reviews scared me .Noisy fan ,can't hear the fan at all.So do I have any complaints ? Well yes ,not serious ones .Too few USB's only 2 ,I always had 3 and miss the extra one.The keys are ok ,only ok ,not excited about them.Also I thought the keyboard was backlit,well ttheyr'e not..Despite those negatives ,I think I will really love this computer .I think you will too.I'm glad I waited for the 8th generation ,it's great.1/14/2018 :After using this for a couple of weeks ,I have simmered down a bit.First I wish the screen was a little sharper and being a small screen it gets a little hard to read the lettering.I also notice that the sound while ok ,is not too great.I'm comparing this Zen to a Lenovo ideapad which is 6 or 7 years old,much sharper, better sound ,but almost twice as heavy.I notice it is (kinda) backlit ,again not as well backlit as the Lenovo .I will say the Lenovo cost $200 more than the Zen.What I appreciate most is the 7 second boot time and the long battery life.2/2/2018An update.I got a scare a week ago.I got a black screen ,it wouldn't boot.I kept trying turning of and on for an hour.Eventually it started to work again.I did a restore point.The only problem with buying a computer online is ,it's not easy to return.Prices are better on Amazon but unlike Best Buy you can't drive and return it.Food for thought.	2	5	2	3	4
This is really my backup/travel computer. I have a high-end model that I do not like to take on the road. I purchased this model to fill in that gap. It has virtually everything I need. Backlit. Light. Good graphics. I don't game with it, so I can't speak to gaming. I only gave it 4 stars for a couple of reasons. 1) The on-off key is located on the upper right of the keyboard, right next to the DELETE key. I can't say how many times I've gone to delete something and accidentally turned off the machine. 2) The ARROW keys are in a funky arrangement, and they are inappropriately sized.All in all though, I like the machine. Since I keep everything on a cloud anyway, I'm not too concerned if this dies. But it's been very reliable. It starts incredibly fast. Some features are much better than my Yoga. No touch-screen though. But that would have added some serious $$ to the price.	2	5	2	3	4
A couple days ago first one came in an unopened clean box. Laptop was clean and untouched. It was flawless! I was so happy after TEN years with my good old 5.8 lb VAIO, which I'm writing this review on. Everything was great and laptop was so smooth, fast, lightweight, it has awesome track pad sensitivity and feeling (contrary to reviews I've seen) and a beautiful design, BUT... There was an incredible buzzing noise whenever I scroll down/up. I'm not sure if it was coming from the fan or something, but it sounded like it'd be a serious problem in a foreseeable future. I've returned it. The second one came today. Product box was already opened (black tape with ASUS logo on it was cut) and it was really disappointing. Still, I kept going to see if it were acceptable or not. There were fingerprints everywhere, a scratch on the screen and another one on the case. Annoying white dust stuck between the bottom side of the screen and the bezel (I don't know how did they manage to do that because there is almost no even any space between the screen and the bezel!). And lastly, Windows 10 installing guide was different than the first one. It was weird/clipped and made me uncomfortable. Frustrated, I've returned that too and got a refund. I'll probably wait a little before I order another one or look for a different laptop. I'm so sorry about all this because it's a beautifully designed and really fast laptop -according to my 2 day experience with the first one-...	2	5	2	3	4
"This laptop replaced an older 11"" Asus VivoBook, which had served us well for years but was getting doggy. This laptop Is a great travel/around-the-house/light office work model. Form factor is fantastic, THIN, like WAFER THIN, and very light. Great case design and quality construction. Snappy as all get out: more than sufficient processing power from the i5 8250U chip, sufficient memory to support everyday activity, and SSD for quick boot and file access. No qualms about performance whatsoever. Keyboard and trackpad are good quality with snappy reaction. Screen is pretty good, although there is a little light bleed evident at the bottom and top bezels on boot-up. Not noticeable during operation, though. Integrated graphics are fine for typical Windows operations and video rendering, but not recommend this laptop for any sort of demanding applications or gaming."	2	5	2	3	4
I have had multiple issues with this laptop.1. The laptop refuses to balance on all 4 of its rubber feet which makes it extremely hard to balance it on any flat surface without experiencing significant screen wobble.2. The OS crashed and refused to do a complete system restore.3. Experienced terrible wi-fi issues (Public Network only) which turned out to be a driver issue that corrupted after Windows launched the Fall Creators Update4. Terrible fan rattling noise which definitely felt like there was something pushing against it.Overall I personally have had a very bad experience with the laptop and returned both the original and the replacement orders	2	5	2	3	4
The Asus Zenbook Ultra-Slim Laptop is everything I wanted.I purchased the 8th gen i5 core and is by far the best laptop I owned for such price.It's very slim, works super fast, and that touch-screen login is just AMAZING.The fan sometimes briefly makes a loud sound you're running too many apps, but that never bothered me.The battery time is by far impeccable. This thing lasts me 8-12 hours depending on the apps I'm using and the brightness setting.The screen is a bit flimsy and not as sturdy as most laptops (as in it kinda shakes when you move it around, but not to the point where it's a flaw in my opinion.)I'm just completely in love with its design and everything about it is delightful to me.	2	5	2	3	4
I have had this laptop for a little over a month now and am really happy with it. It is a good middle of the road laptop. It is light and slim which makes it great for traveling and working online.Pros:- Very light and portable but doesn't feel chintzy. It seems to be constructed well.-The i5 does pretty well. The onboard graphics will bottleneck in certain situations, though, I have only encountered this when gaming.-As just mentioned this will handle light gaming. I play Skyrim with medium settings and have good framerate any more than that and it will bog down. I was able to play overwatch as well but had to do a lot of fiddling with the graphics to get it to run smooth.-This is my first computer with an SSD and I love them. From the time you push power, you can be opening your web browser in 15 seconds. It also helps with the dreaded windows update. It takes SIGNIFICANTLY less time to update.-The harman/kardon speakers are great they have a good sound quality for a laptop speaker and are plenty loud.-The battery life is very good. It will stay charged for 5 or 6 hours while gaming while connected to the internet and full brightness. Essentially, you will have 5 to 6 hours of battery at the least. You can get at least 12 hours with light use.-A common complaint about this laptop is a loud fan. I haven't experienced this at all. Mine is very quiet and works well.- I use it for photo editing via lightroom and it does well.Cons:-The screen doesn't have a wide range of motion. It probably only goes to 100 degrees or so.-As I said you can do light gaming with this but if you a really into gaming and want to play with high settings this isn't for you.Overall this laptop is great for work a little above your typical internet streaming and word processing. This is probably the best value you will find before moving into the Ultrabook tier.	2	5	2	3	4
I really like this computer. The only thing that is a bit off for me is the keyboard is not great. sometimes I hit the key and it does not register. This is particularly frustrating when coding. It could be my typing but I don't have issues with other keyboards. Also, the touch pad is a little different to use. It's touch is a little off. All in all this is a really good buy.	2	5	2	3	4
I don't know why this has so many good reviews regarding the screen. I absolutely could not stand the matte screen with the rainbow shimmering effect, especially on white backgrounds. It gave me headaches just after a few minutes, so I knew I couldn't keep it. The backlight bleed was horrible on dark apps like Visual Studio Code, or photo editing tools that use a dark background. Uneven backlight just kills the usefulness for many workflows, too.Performance-wise, it was as you'd expect out of the 8th generation Core i5's. I was content with that aspect, and the hardware build was sufficiently nice for its price-point.I just wish that there were more reviews cautioning me about the display quality, or I would have never gone with this model. I went with an Dell Inspiron 7373 with similar specs for a hundred dollars less on sale, and I've been plenty happy with the screen on that model instead.	2	5	2	3	4
I am so inlove with this laptop. When I got it I felt like a kid with christmas gift. It is very light, what I am still admiring, and the size perfectly fits my smaller backpack, so I can carry it with myself whenever I need. It is really very fast, its almost have no sound ( if I want to hear, I have to stop what I am doing and try to listen) and I love the keyboard, which makes very smooth writting feeling. I really like that the screen has eye-saving mode, so it will not get tired. And the battery last for about 6-7 hours without charging. I am still enjoying to work with it.	2	5	2	3	4
I don't know where you can get so much power in so sleek-cool package for the price. Hits the ground running with software set-up. Start to deployable for use in about and hour. Windows 10 and Office 365 comes preloaded saving hours of download (yea!)... just add accounts and passwords. Seamless link to existing wireless hardware and drivers.I've purchased 3 ZenBooks. This edition is better integrated with Windows for ease of set-up. I appreciate ASUS's cutting the bloat-ware load.Great value for money. No cons.	2	5	2	3	4
This is the worst laptop I’ve ever had in my life. My wireless connection was too slow, so I updated the wireless driver and got this resolved. But the battery driver stopped working and now it’s not detected by the OS. The laptop doesn’t turn on without the AC adapter. Already tried to reinstall Windows but didn’t worked as well. And I can’t send it back to amazon because I live in another country. Also, ASUS global warranty assistance does not work in my country Brazil. I bought this laptop a month ago. I’ve been saving money for a laptop for 2 years and now my brand new laptop is broken and useless. I tried everything, since reinstalling official drivers, restoring from a previous point and reinstalling Windows. I can’t even describe my frustration.	2	5	2	3	4
I'm a computer science student so having a PORTABLE laptop is essential. I really made an investment in this because it's a lot more expensive than my original price point but this laptop has everything I needed.The laptop is slim and super light so it's extremely portable.The battery lasts for FOREVER. I took this to a hackathon and at one point I was away from my charger and it lasted in power save mode for at least 3-4 hours after it got below 25%. It would have lasted longer but I plugged it in as soon as I could.The screen is awesome. I noticed a lot of the reviews before I bought this complained about the screen being too dim but for me its perfect. It's not extremely bright which really saves your eyes if you're up until midnight writing some code :^)Also, the i5 8th gen processor makes this laptop worth every penny.	2	5	2	3	4
Packaging was fine and the box was neat with no dents. When I saw the item I was so excited. Unfortunately when I turned on the laptop, it was glitching out from the start. The audio was fine too. I was so disappointed. The look and feel of the laptop is great. Will be returning and ordering a replacement.	2	5	2	3	4
I really liked this laptop HOWEVER I want every prospective buyer to know that USB-C port of this laptop does not support any video output thus it does not recognize any usb-c to HDMI converters. I have tried an apple converter and another (UGReen) converter , it does not recognize the HDMI video output.... ASUS should have mentioned this clear.USB-C to ethernet is recognized through the port..Now i have to buy separate cables.. I wish ASUS would have put a full HDMI port.	2	5	2	3	4
I really wanted to like this computer. And I did, except that the battery didn't work. It's fast and has a nice keyboard and display. It's very light weight and attractive. Mine apparently had a defective battery that wouldn't charge, and the OS reported 'No battery installed.' I returned it. Amazon was very good about the return.	2	5	2	3	4
"The performance of this laptop is great, but the level of pressure for the ""e"" key is much greater than the forc required to press other keys, which makes it annoying when I'm typing because I'll often press the ""e"" key too lightly for it to register when that amount of force would be fine on any other key (this is a mechanical issue). This fairly little problem causes me to have to retype a lot of words, and it is the only problem I have with it, although I bet it's just a problem with my specific laptop. If this didn't occur I'd give it 5 stars. I might return it to get the same model."	2	5	2	3	4
So good I just bought another one. Fast, light, bright sharp screen, SSD makes boot up just a few seconds. Thin and great battery life averaging 8-10 hours of use between charges. That's about once every 3-4 days of casual use for me. The only improvement I can think of is to make the keys a little more curved instead of flat. But other than that, it's a perfect laptop. Does not come with a huge amount of bloatware that needs to be removed. The speakers are not too bad either.The Dell XPS 13 may be better but at $1300 compared to this one at $750, this one is a much better value.	2	5	2	3	4
Got this laptop for computer science courseWas skeptical about this laptop but im so glad i got it!Zero problems like coil whine etc, for some reason i love the look including the bezel, and actually think it looks much better than the ux430 (my friend has it), performance is great with the 8th gen cpu. I was concernced with the slow ssd but its perfectly adequate!Overall great laptop at a great price	2	5	2	3	4
This is a great laptop and I would give it 5 stars except for one thing. I do wish ASUS had not installed Mcafee. It is part of the system and automatically reminds you to renew once your 'trial' subscription has ended. You can decline but you will continue to get reminders to renew several times a day and this is very annoying. I have tried to find ways to stop this even removing Mcafee from the system and going to there site to see what I can do about it so far no luck	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop is fantastic. Light, with an aluminum shell. The keyboard has a little give, but that is pretty similar to my previous laptop and chromebook. The laptop moves quickly, the screen is bright and crisp, stays connected to the internet. Gaming is pretty limited as this isn't a gaming laptop but the intel hd 620 chipset handles 3d images with no problem and modern games can be played with a bit of tweaking.	2	5	2	3	4
As a Mac lover, I need a Windows machine to take care some tasks. The ASUS ZenBook does the trick. I am sorry the RAM cannot be increased. The boot-up time is an impressive 25 seconds and handles apps like Dropbox well. I am particularly impressed with the responsive track pad compared to my older Windows machine made in 2014. All in all, great pick for the price.	2	5	2	3	4
I received my asus zenbook ux330ua today and was so excited to begin working on it. However, I immediately noticed how dark the screen is and even when I adjust the screen brightness to the highest setting, it is still very dark. I was very disappointed about this. I have attached a picture to show a comparison between the screen brightness of a hp laptop and the asus I just received.	2	5	2	3	4
Very satisfied. On line very helpful on setting up. Took over my computer and helped set it up. Perfect for my use. Of course there will always be something better value coming on the market, but was good value at the time I bought it without having to pay a fortune. Like everything except that the mouse seems very sensitive and I prefer an external mouse. Also I am not sure that the battery lasts as long as is advertised, but long enogh for my purpose.	2	5	2	3	4
Stable, fast, well designed. Average sound but very good monitor. This is a better alternative to Dell which I use for work, it’s really a great buy at this price too, I like it so much I ended up buying two.	2	5	2	3	4
This thing is tiny. It weighs so little I went to lift it up thinking it would be as heavy as my old one and it nearly flew out of my hands because it's so light. It's powerful, and connects to my external drives easily.	2	5	2	3	4
Excellent value, super thin and light almost everything work very well including the touchpad (saw reviews that it was stiff but my family is fine with it). The only thing that could be a bit better is the quality of the IPS screen. I would have paid +$50 for a better monitor. But totally do not regret the purchase and would probably buy it again.	2	5	2	3	4
"the bluetooth has is stopped two times working after 5 or 6 hours of use, it appears ""Unknown device (code 43)"" on the device manager. Looks like the module is afected by the heat, because it works again when I turn off the laptop and wait around for an hour. That's too bad, means a direct hardware problem."	2	5	2	3	4
I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement. I hope I can update my review with a better score when I get the replacement,=== Update ===I got a replacement. The new one looks okay. At least, there are no big gaps or exposed wires.	2	5	2	3	4
I received my new laptop a few weeks ago and must say I love my ZenBook! Super light, super thin, and super fast! I was worried I would have a lot of bloatware (as my Dell came with) but besides a couple of games I could easily delete, it was just right! The fingerprint scanner is nice, but not as good as an iPhone. It doesn’t always read accurately-not a big enough problem to doc a rating from. Overall very pleased.	2	5	2	3	4
At first it was all okay but after some usage, the metal screen frame started to levitate from bottom and made hard to open the computer. I have sent to ASUS for repair, received now but nothing seems changed. I think the product is defective or it is second-quality. I don't recommend this product. Additionally, it is so hard to get your problem solved by the actual people who can help in terms of replacement or refund.	2	5	2	3	4
I bought this for my son in January. The charge lasts the entire day at school, and I know that it is not all used for educational purposes.The display is very matt and gives the impression of not being sharp, but in fact it is quite ok and it proves very useful in bright environments, and you get no reflection.The keyboard is quite good and feels nice.It doesn't produce noise (except when under a lot of pressure mainly during updates and heavy graphics usage).The ports are great and useful.The storage and memory are also at the sweep spot, and well balanced.So overall extremely happy, given that the price difference here in australia for a similar spec would be around the $500.	2	5	2	3	4
I needed a laptop that could withstand travel. I like the solid state hard drive, the slim profile and the matte screen. I have a second laptop that is my photography processing workhorse that never leaves my office so I did not need a lot of hard drive space or RAM. I use this laptop for internet research/shopping and writing. I am very happy with my purchase.	2	5	2	3	4
I received it 2 weeks ago and so far so good.Just a few notes for the potential buyers and the one who are still not sure whether to purchase it or not.1- Out of the box every thing was fine, but the WiFi download speed. It was terrible and I were sure something is wrong. I normally have around 50 Mbps download and around 100 Mbps upload speed. However, with this laptop it was around 1 Mbps download and almost 100 Mbps upload speed. I searched the web, but there were some wrong info. I reinstalled windows, updated WiFi driver through device manager but it was not the solution. The only solution was to update the Windows to the latest version (Windows 10 Fall Creators Update) and afterward upgrading the WiFi driver via the Intel's website (I mean downloading the driver from intel's website not the device manager). Now every thing is fine and the download and upload speed are as they should be.2- Besides the above mentioned issue, the most important issue, is the fan noise. I mean it starts working when you don't believe it is necessary and makes of course noise. I haven't checked the CPU temperature, but I found the cooling fan active when I was downloading a bis software package and installing some others which I believe is not that much. However, it seems it's due to the thickness of the laptop and it gets warm very quick.3- Last but not least, although the production quality is fine enough, the casing material (The Aluminium alloy I think) is not that great. You can easily feel the difference with a high-end laptop body like Apple MacBooks. However, that's not bad at all, it's just not premium.For the best parts, I would choose first the weight. You can't imagine how thin and light is that. Furthermore, the battery last for almost the whole day and you can be sure that you won't get out of charge through the day. Although ASUS claims 12 hours, for the mixes tasks like internet browsing, movie watching, some office works and general university stuff, you can be sure to have at least 8 hours of charge.All in all, I rate this great machine 5 star, since price-wise it's even more than the best. You get the latest Intel Core i5 together with 8GB RAM and 256 SSD in s very thin and light body just for 750$. That's great and I am satisfied till now.	2	5	2	3	4
So far, so good. Great form factor and fast. Not too much bloatware, just uninstall McAfee crap. The screen looks good and the flat (non glossy) finish works well for clarity and wide angle of viewing. I travel often and replaced a 6 year old Acer ultrabook at about the same pricepoint. Since Acer isn't a high end brand, I hope to get similar long life out of this one. I'll update if it doesn't perform as expected.	2	5	2	3	4
Product was as described. I bought from Amazon. This is the 8gb 256gbssd 13in fhd asus ux330ua-ah55 8th gen intel core i5 processor.Laptop is thin, light, and fast enough for daily use. Build is very sturdy, very nice aluminum body. Ordered last Nov23, 2017 and recieved on Nov 28.I love the FHD antiglare display and matte screen. The fingerprint sensor works very well for me. It has enough ports for me, the SD card sticks out when plugged in as seen in the picture.The fans turn on with moderate tasks such as video editing and photoshop, but it is not that loud to me.Keyboard is backlit and takes a little getting used to due to shorter key travel compared from my older laptop.The trackpad is just ok, it is not the best. I dont use the web camera so I cant say anything for it.Sounds on this laptop has good quality, I can hear a little bass and it is loud enough to fill the living room and can be heard outside the house.Battery life so far lasts about 8 to 10hours. Laptop is for mobility.This laptop is great for me and I would recommend it. Worth it for its price.ASUS ZenBook Ultra-Slim Laptop, 13.3-inch Full HD, 8th gen Intel i5-8250U Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Backlit keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, Anti-Glare, Windows 10, Grey, UX330UA-AH55	2	5	2	3	4
Excellent value for money, thin, slim and beautifully designed, as for the specs latest gen core i5 processor and 8 gb of RAM are more than enough for everyday taks and even light gaming and video editing. The keyboard feels really good but not as good as a Macbook if you are upgrading from one of those as is my case, the screen is decent but probably the least quality item from the pack. Mine came with 3 dead pixels but it was impossible to return it since I brought it to my home country in South America and I found out it doesn't have international warranty, so this is something you need to carefully consider if you live outside the US.	2	5	2	3	4
Wow! Great laptop. Amazing speed, lit keyboard and 10 hour battery. Slim and lightweight. Fingerprint access, which works MOST of the time. Rest of he time, use a PIN or your password. Very pleased with this laptop.	2	5	2	3	4
Not a tech kinda person. I just wanted a laptop for uni that would be able to use word and PowerPoint and let me watch my lecture videos. Well, it’s fantastic. Nice and lightweight, thin, sleek and works really well. The best part is that the battery lasts for ages! I use my laptop every day for uni (~6 hours a day maybe more or less depending on the day) and I’ll charge it probably 4 times a week! Love this laptop, definitely recommend!	2	5	2	3	4
"Best bang for the buck at the technology level required for comfortable use. If someone says ""I need a good laptop, nothing fancy, but I don't want any significant compromises"" - this is the one to get."	2	5	2	3	4
Simple and quick setup. No software or function issues. With that said there was a small damage on the back of the laptop display. The smooth metal finish is aesthetically pleasing but the multiple imperfection show up quite easily. This does affect the overall perception of the product, which seem to have flaws in the manufacturing process. There were no issues with the packaging however.	2	5	2	3	4
Love the size of this computer, but it takes an act of God to get the keyboard to work with any degree of ease.	2	5	2	3	4
Exactly what I needed, slick and hearty. There are other reviews that complain of fan noise: I can tell when the fan is on, but it's not super noticeable. I'm not sure if my unit is just soft spoken or if the people complaining of fan noise are super sensitive. Track pad works great, fingerprint reader is a nice feature. All in all, a really good unit.	2	5	2	3	4
Something is very wrong with the wireless adapter. I contacted customer service at Asus multiple times and have not received the help I need.	2	5	2	3	4
The sensitive area of the touchpad overlaps the left and right mouse buttons. The designers must have eaten too many Tide Pods. Seriously ... why would anyone cover buttons on a keyboard with the touchpad?	2	5	2	3	4
Amazing ultrabook. I purchased mine refurbished and besides some faint scratching on the hinge, everything is perfect. Stellar battery life and performance. Fingerprint sensor is nice. Back-lit keyboard and screen are all very bright. Only wish they would include a micro HDMI to HDMI adapter in the box.	2	5	2	3	4
All good. Great laptop. perfect size and decent battery life. Exactly what I needed. My only problem is that the fan sometimes makes some noise and gets heated up pretty fast, and it's just my second day! It would make some noise for a few mins and then go back to normal. I'm just pretty concerned that it's only my second day of using it..	2	5	2	3	4
This is now my main machine, I got this on a warehouse deal and could not be happier. The keyboard backlight, battery life, power, everything has been spectacular.	2	5	2	3	4
This replaces the mac air in weight. I enjoy it very much. As I seem to be more of a Windows user, then a Max user.	2	5	2	3	4
Very disappointed with this device. I loved it at first but appears the hinge that connects the top to the keyboard is very cheap and easily torn. It also freezes completely on occasion and not sure what causes this problem. I am sending it in to be repaired and may request a refund.	2	5	2	3	4
This is a slick little laptop, especially for the money. The processor flies and the slim size and light weight make it SUCH an improvement over my old balky Dell. The comments in the trade press and here about the track pad are true - its definitely the weak link in the hardware. But I'm getting used to it gradually. For not much money they could make this SO much better with a better pad.	2	5	2	3	4
the mouse is almost completely unresponsive and makes scrolling or browsing (the main purpose of this laptop) nearly impossible. I am not picky but this is unusable! Do not buy this laptop! I am out of the 30 day return policy otherwise I would return this asap!	2	5	2	3	4
Super slim and light perfect for backpack to school. Nice screen. Windows version of MacBook Air	2	5	2	3	4
This is an awesome laptop for working and light gaming! A few things that may annoy people: fans do get a bit loud even if if you are not doing heavy stuff like watching Netflix or Twitch, screen is not at best at the light of a sunny day but it's not bad! Overall easily best laptop for the money that you can get in this price range.	2	5	2	3	4
thin and slicenice laptop for student who take it out everydaystrong performance with core 8 th gen cpukeyboard with automatic backlitbut...LDDR3 memory come on it is 2018 Asus.. why not get ddr4?the edge of screen is too thick for a 2017 portable laptop otherwise it could make to 14inch display with its size	2	5	2	3	4
Was an OK computer, but ordered the more expensive model, which was worth the extra $100	2	5	2	3	4
I never could get it to turn on, even after 6 hours of charging. Sent it back, and haven't had the nerve to replace it yet.	2	5	2	3	4
This is the best laptop I have ever owned, albeit I've only owned one before this, it was made to run windows. The internal hard drive makes everything better, and it looks chic to display.	2	5	2	3	4
Great laptop. Great lightweight computer for commuting. Works as advertised. Excellent battery life ( I can get 10 hours with battery saver on sometimes). My only complaint is that the trackpad is kind of crappy. You get used to it after awhile, but it can be a little wonky. Everything else works great.	2	5	2	3	4
The laptop is gorgeous. A bit smaller than expected. This is a dim computer, so if you are looking for a bright display, this is not it. Also, the video pixelates and are blurry. I am returning it for these reasons.	2	5	2	3	4
I've been using this computer for 5 months now and I absolutely love it! It's fast and easy to use. So light and comfortable to carry around. Exactly what I wanted!	2	5	2	3	4
I would say that I will recommend this computer especially for college students! It’s an overall 5 stars! From shipping, packaging to quality and performance.	2	5	2	3	4
Great computer for the price	2	5	2	3	4
My husband and I are not very tech savy people, but we really like our ZenBook. It is very lightweight and very fast.	2	5	2	3	4
I got this laptop for the purpose of college/graduate school, and am so far highly satisfied with the laptop. It is incredibly light and thin, and runs very quickly! It is a very compact size, has a very sharp display, and is very affordable. Would definitely recommend this laptop to any college student!	2	5	2	3	4
Still setting things up. . . . .this thing is lightening fast. Keep hitting the power button instead of delete though!	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop may not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive computers do, but it gets the job done at a more reasonable price. It is very quiet while operating and is super lightweight and portable. Meets all the basic needs of a student.	2	5	2	3	4
Excelent laptop for the price, buy with the i5 core 8th generation.	2	5	2	3	4
"really fast. light.Awkward placement of ""delete"" button."	2	5	2	3	4
The first thing I noticed after turning it on for the first time were bright spots around the perimeter of the screen but mostly at the bottom. Not a big deal when on the web but when watching watching a movie and the background became dark, it was annoying. See the photo.I heard good things about Asus customer support which is one of the main reasons I got the computer. I let them know about the problem and they responded once asking if I dropped it to which I told them no and then never heard back even after a couple more attempts. At that point I initiated a return with Amazon who of course was great.The aluminum body is nice but I was not impressed with the build quality because it has a lot of flex to it. Overall it felt cheap.Anyway, glad a lot of people like the computer and I hate leaving anything less than a 5 star review but 3 stars in my case was more than generous.	2	5	2	3	4
Horrible. My computer gives me a blue screen that doesn’t go away unless I shut down the whole computer losing any work I didn’t save.Did attempt to remove and redownload Microsoft Offiice. But did not fix the issue.	2	5	2	3	4
The screen is a yellow tint and if you are not used to it as I was, it is annoying and the clarity seems bad. After a time, you do get used to it so that's great.	2	5	2	3	4
Arrived safe and sound.	2	5	2	3	4
Great laptop, light and easy to use. Still compatible with all the software I used for Window 7.	2	5	2	3	4
Very fast and light, great for internet browsing, casual gaming, music, ect. Not for intensive games.	2	5	2	3	4
This computer is super fast and works great. Nice battery life, and way better value than those overpriced MacBooks.	2	5	2	3	4
Great computer so far! Lightweight, streamline, works quickly, great screen. Very happy so far. I do wish the keys were slightly more raised, but I will get used to the new keyboard I am sure.	2	5	2	3	4
It has everything that I look for in a laptop. Excellent performance and battery life, fantastic set of connectivity options, high-quality keyboard and trackpad, lightweight body,	2	5	2	3	4
The best purchase in terms of computers. Sometimes it is a little noisy but the battery life and the light weight combined with it's practicality make it a wonderful choice.	2	5	2	3	4
Great laptop. Very useful.	2	5	2	3	4
In the middle of trying to resolve an issue with the laptop frequently losing WiFi internet connection whereas our other devices stay connected. Hopeful that we don’t have a lemon. Love the slim lightweight design.	2	5	2	3	4
Came with a wobbly base. Fan was also making a sharp sound at times - not sure if that's a big deal but the uneven base killed it for me.	2	5	2	3	4
Excellent value even with import tax, very fast, light and great quality. You will need a 2 to 3 pin adaptor for the UK and of course it’s got a US keyboard layout but that’s not really a problem.	2	5	2	3	4
I got this computer for college, and it is perfect for me. The only problem is the touchpad is very touchy. Other than that I am very happy I made this purchase.	2	5	2	3	4
The delivery was very quick without any damage to the laptop. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. Smooth interface and no lags. cheers to Amazon.	2	5	2	3	4
Love it. Hard to get used to the smaller size, but it is perfect for school since I have to carry it around with me.	2	5	2	3	4
Runs smoothly and works good for starting photography.	2	5	2	3	4
I love this laptop, perfect laptop for my college use. I love the matte screen, it's not glossy so there is no glare. It's super thin and portable.	2	5	2	3	4
If you're looking for a light laptop, for school that can do basic workload and a little more. This is the one for you. Glad I purchased this!	2	5	2	3	4
Awesome service delivery timed perfectly, brilliant product - have spent much time enjoying the features of this lightweight machine.	2	5	2	3	4
Just got this computer 3 days ago.. it's blazing fast, feels solid and looks good.. the aluminum body gives it a premium feel and I love it..so far everything is working as it should.. battery seems to last a lot, but probably because i'm comparing to my 6 years old laptop that had only like an hour o so.. anyway, I'm very happy with my purchase and recommends to anyone looking for a new ultrabook..	2	5	2	3	4
Never regret buying it	2	5	2	3	4
Got exactly what I expected and performs flawlessly. The SSD makes a huge difference.The i5 compares to last gen's i7 at a fraction of the cost.	2	5	2	3	4
Loved the zenbook for its lightness and easy to carry. Good battery life. It will be better if ssd drive can can be higher capacity.	2	5	2	3	4
Overall is good, although the touch pad is a bit annoying when using it.	2	5	2	3	4
A laptop with good performance, very light! I liked it!	2	5	2	3	4
Im very stoked with my new computer. Light, fast, good battery and very nice look. Working good so far. Recommend.	2	5	2	3	4
Loving this laptop so far. The battery and screen are great. The sound is okay, as expected for a laptop of this size. The keyboard is a little weird however. I'm a pretty fast typer, and the short travel on the keys makes it a little difficult to type with. I swear I've never misspelled as much as I have with this keyboard. The wireless is super fast. The SSD makes for super quick loading, including bootups and shutdowns. The fingerprint reader is a MUST. I will never go back to a laptop without a fingerprint reader after having this computer. Overall, a great buy.	2	5	2	3	4
Outstanding device for the money....	2	5	2	3	4
Starts up quick, runs what I need for school effortlessly, and weighs next to nothing.	2	5	2	3	4
Best bang for the buck.	2	5	2	3	4
Loved it	2	5	2	3	4
Excellent machine!	2	5	2	3	4
No annoying fan noise, just normal fan spin when the computer is under load.	2	5	2	3	4
I got broken one when lid was not in good shape.	2	5	2	3	4
Outstanding laptop. Excellent deal for the price. Light and fast	2	5	2	3	4
Amazing product. Great for all my home pc meeds and more.	2	5	2	3	4
great laptop, well worth it. no fan problems, great speakers, and beautiful screen.	2	5	2	3	4
Bought brand new. Display came with a stuck pixel (google it). Annoying for factory default/brand new. Battery is advertised as 12 hours all over. Realistically, it’s more like 5-8 with moderate usage.UPDATE - My battery was at 32% at the beginning of my evening class (6:30PM), and by 6:50 PM the laptop was at 3%, then died immediately after. The percentage shown is not accurate at all, and the battery life seems to be getting worse over time.	2	5	2	3	4
It's an amazing notebook. Very fast with an incredible design. Worth every cent.	2	5	2	3	4
Loud coil whine and Hugh fan speed seemingly at random but otherwise great laptop	2	5	2	3	4
You pay less and you get more... great buy...	2	5	2	3	4
I think this item has a great per dollar value	2	5	2	3	4
Amazing laptop at a great price!	2	5	2	3	4
Beautiful. Fast, lightweight. Does what it should do.	2	5	2	3	4
Very good laptop, I am fully satisfied.	2	5	2	3	4
Firstly, this laptop gets MAYBE 4 hours of battery life, which is 1/3 the advertised 12h. The ONLY programs I use are browsers, FTP, and Textpad, and I keep the battery settings dialed way down. Secondly, I've owned it for less than 4 months and the adapter just stopped working. And I take care of my equipment; it's not like I throw it around. I wish I'd stuck with Acer. Thirdly, when I attempted to contact Asus about getting a speedy replacement? Nothing. Crickets. No response via email, my Asus account, or twitter. Nice.Other than the poor service, poor battery life, and poor adapter quality, everything else was pretty nice.	2	5	2	3	4
Love the 8th gen, the slick design	2	5	2	3	4
It's nimble!	2	5	2	3	4
good service and nice product...	2	5	2	3	4
I am a previous owner of a ASUS UX31A that I bought in mid 2013. It finally wore out, I liked it so bought this one as a replacement. Though it is fine there are a few unadvertised changes that irk me. First, this one does not open nearly as much as the UX31A. The UX31A would open almost 150 degrees, this one only to about 130 degrees. I have already run into operating situations where this I miss the old spec. For instance if the laptop is on a kitchen counter and you are standing to use it -- you really want that extra opening angle. Second, the UX31A power supply was made so the two prongs would fold back into the body of the power cube. This was great when you threw it into your carry case so the prongs would not poke into anything. Not so with this new one. They stick out and that's it. The UX31A came with a slip case. Not this one. Finally the speakers on the UX31A were on a bar in front of the function keys. On this one they come out the bottom of the case. Sound can be muffled. In my mind 3 poor design decisions and one just cheap cost saving measure. Now I am disappointed. If I had known these things I would have looked around some more before purchasing it.	2	5	2	3	4
"2 stars is ""I don't like it"", which is true. Its cheaply made. My first one had a issue with the sound, couldn't hear from internal speaker or through headphones. With this one, the frame for the screen has peeled off from the screen so now I gotta glue it together. Another issue is it sounds like there is a wire that is loose and is being hit by the fan. Also, it often runs very hot with just a browser open or Netflix running. I have to operate a Linux partition to avoid that last issue but there are somethings I must use Windows for. This is sad because my last Asus laptop was less expensive but ran much better than this. Best thing about this thing is the long battery life and nice display, but overall it's not worth it."	2	5	2	3	4
"Its fan is loud after a few months. One annoying thing is the ""McAfee LiveSafe"" subscription. I guess ASUS has a linked thing with the computer protection thing called "" McAfee Livesafe."" it expires after a few months and it pops up annoyingly. It forces you to pay for it. I mean I guess. I was hoping there was a windows firewall already or something? But really? lol.... Overall the laptop is fine. It reminds me of the Apple laptops. no bad. The fingerprint reader is nice too. Wish the speakers were on top but they are realy awesome. Idk i like it and i love it."	2	5	2	3	4
Battery DOA, the laptop wouldn't turn on, and when plugged in to a power adapter, didn't recognize the existence of a battery, the windows battery indicator said 0% available, plugged, in not charging!! Brand new, out of box laptop. Ordered a replacement, will see how that fares. Be warned.	2	5	2	3	4
Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Now she's got the best computer in the house. Fabulous picture and very fast. Only drawback is that Windows needs to work a little on their tablet mode interface.	2	5	2	3	4
I just got this computer so I won't say much here right now. But one thing I don't like is the promise of a 12 hour battery life. Mine can go from fully charged to dead in 6 hours. And it has taken 3 hours to fully charge up again. Not good.	2	5	2	3	4
Exactly what I was looking for! Plus, part of the proceeds go towards a great cause! If you pair that with amazon smile, then you’re donating to two causes with one purchase.	2	5	2	3	4
I receive yesterday, and despite the wonderful computer, speed and very light. the battery was not recognise by the computer. it means that I am returning back the computer. Hope the new one that I will get tomorrow can come correctly.	2	5	2	3	4
Ok, so I did major, major research on this puppy. Really, there isn't much else in the category that comes close to this price.Unfortunately, the Touchpad drivers (which I discovered have been a WELL KNOWN ISSUE for several years) were complete junk, and all it took was one Windows update to basically make the thing useless. In total, I spent probably about 8 hours trying to find a solution, but every time I restarted after brief periods of success, the Touchpad was dead again.Oh, did I mention no touchscreen? Yep. Just junky. I would add that I also discovered that ASUS has a wide variety of screen problems in everything from their tablets to this laptop. If your screen cracks internally, you'll be on the hook for it, no warranty. Final note on the screen: I can't believe how cheap and plastick-y it is. I felt like this was a laptop from 2005!Believe me, I SOOOO WANTED to love this laptop. But man... just absolute garbage. Save yourself a disaster.	2	5	2	3	4
Very good and good price	2	5	2	3	4
After a day of use, the screen has a yellow tint to it. It is terrible. This problem was not in any reviews but easily found when doing a search. I would not recommend this product.	2	5	2	3	4

"I like the laptop itself (although I never did get around to checking out the speakers, because of all the problems I had trying to set up the OS the way I wanted (can't be done), getting it to run the software I want to use & accept the file associations I wanted to set). Then there is the fact that Windows 10 is loaded with bloatware you can't uninstall or even disable, all kinds of subscription ""services"" that just cost you money--including the formerly free games like freecell & solitaire, it collects all kinds of information whether you want it to or not, which you can limit somewhat but not eliminate, & generally just insists on running your computer however it wants to regardless of anything you might want or need."	2	5	2	3	4

I have multiple ticket numbers. For some reason, they kept issuing me new ticket numbers for each reply it seems.Here are the few I could dig up.N180117529N180249415N1801139402N1801160374N1801160149N1801136813N1801139635N180335047Only after a couple months of buying a new ASUS ZenBook the touchpad begin failing.In the beginning of January, I filed a ticket to get it serviced due to a failing trackpad.I sent it in. First of all, it's ridiculous I had to pay for shipping but I can deal with that.I explained the problem in detail to support and even recorded a video of the issue. The laptop was sent back and the problem was not addressed. I contacted support and told them they did not fix the problem. I asked them what they did. They said they replaced the trackpad. I told them I had video evidence. They would not admit to this and offered to do another RMA.I agreed to send it in a second time. Again, they assured me it would be fixed. They said I would get priority support.I get it back and the trackpad doesn't click some of the time and now it's physically tilted. It's actually in worse condition. It actually took longer to get the laptop back this second time.I contact them again and asked just to get my money back. They said they cannot do this but said they would send me a replacement laptop. I agreed. This time, DAYS and DAYS go by and it's still in repair status. All they have to do is verify my laptop was received and send me a replacement I thought. I contact this nightmare of a support team and they say they are verifying my laptop has an issue. I ask to escalate the issue multiple time. I am assured it has been. I am now sitting on at least 3 days and have not heard back from a supervisor. They can't tell me who should be contacting me or when. The only thing I'm told is that the supervisor might not be in his office.I have lost countless hours and dollars having to use an old and slow laptop attempting to get things done.ASUS customer service is absolutely horrible.I have multiple ticket numbers. Here are just a few:N180117529N180249415N1801139402N1801160374N1801160149N1801136813N1801139635N180335047	2	5	2	3	4
This model has no touch screen and no tablet configuration	2	5	2	3	4
I own the UX330 (7th gen), and I love the battery life. I dual boot Ubuntu and run that as my main OS, and I routinely get 12 hours on it. I would highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't need a dedicated graphics card (photo/video editing, gaming) as the battery life is phenomenal.I try to charge it at around 40% and not past 80% to preserve battery life, so I only get about 5-6 hours SOT, but I'm only using 40% of the battery at a time. It charges quickly, 30 minutes or less to get that 40%, and I almost never turn it off, I just let it sleep. I can let it sleep for a couple days and if it drops 1% in that time I'm surprised.The screen angle is a bit annoying, I wish it would go back a bit further (15 degrees more would be great), but its light and it feels durable (not as nice as a macbook, but its half the price).I have had issues sometimes with the trackpad not responding properly, but I believe thats due to Ubuntu. It works wonderfully in Windows, I never have any issues typing in Windows and my hand usually rests on the trackpad, which caused problems with my previous laptop.The USB C is amazing for me, as my phone is USB C, it really makes life easy. Not as big of a plus if you don't have other usb c devices. The mini HDMI is annoying, I still haven't purchased any miniHDMI to HDMI cables.The speakers are in a terrible spot, underneath the laptop, and they're pretty underpowered. Again, in my mind, that would fall under a media machine, which this is not, so its not a deal breaker for me.My girlfriend purchased the 8th gen. It has a slightly more powerful processer, but less battery life. It still lasts a very long time, and she has no complaints.All in all, I love my laptop. Its unbelievably light, and the battery is awesome, and its more than quick enough for anything I use it for, as I don't do anything graphically intensive.	2	5	2	3	4
"I love this laptop. Coming from a triple-boot MacBook Pro 13"" 12,1 I was seriously doubting the ASUS would compete, but I actually like it better.First thing I did was shrink Windows 10 to install Linux on 1/2 the 256 GB SSD. Everything works great in Ubuntu 17.04, except for the fingerprint reader which is an ""unknown device"" in print and another driver I tried. I don't need the fingerprint reader to work, but it's been flawless everywhere else, and I am a Linux main (work tools).My only gripes could be that the sound is pretty quiet in Windows and though I can get over 100% in Linux it will distort past 100%. Another gripe would be the touchpad isn't as good as my previous MacBook, but that's not much of a surprise. Also the AC power supply is rather cheap, but I couldn't care less about that. If anything I like that I could probably get a generic replacement adapter at Walmart or Goodwill if I need one.The battery life of this ASUS is awesome- I don't need to charge it all day with regular usage. It's very light compared to my MacBook 13"". The keyboard is great and just as good as the Apple in my opinion. The screen is great at 1080p, the i5 eigth gen is fast, the disk is fast. This laptop is built well and does not feel as inexpensive as it is.I don't think there is a better laptop in this price range. Seriously check this one out if you need an ultralight!"	2	5	2	3	4
"I bought this since all of my apple products won't run Linux, and well I'm tired of Apple.Overall the build quality is nice for a $750 laptop. The i5 processor is fast enough to get things done (writing software/browsing/minor video editing). 8gb of ram is ""ok"", but it'd be lovely to have 16gb even if the cost was a bit more as the ram is not upgradable. The SSD is decent but there are faster drives out there, again for the price point not a big deal. 99% of your average consumers won't notice the IO difference between the onboard SSD and something more high end.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars was due to the fact I've had to return this model twice due to screen artifacts and bleeding. I'm not sure if I got 2 bad units in a 6 month span, but either way it's annoying. It's not extremely noticeable but when you're writing code, it can obscure your view.If the screen issues could be resolved, I'd buy another one in a second. Sadly, I'm going to look at other Linux-compatible laptops.Oh and Ps... if you are running Linux a couple of things.1.) Go for Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian as it is supported out of the box2.) If you want that gimmicky fingerprint reader to work, good luck with that lol"	2	5	2	3	4
I love this computer - lightweight, reasonable, great battery life - but the first one I got had a sticky key right out of the box. Amazon replaced it, but then my next computer has had a chronic track pad problem. Customer service has been helpful but after 2-3 times of being walked through the process of re-setting the driver they told me to do a full system re-set. Took a bunch of time and I had to pay to re-install some software, and then one week later the track pad cut out again. I'm preparing to send it in and at least shipping both ways is covered, but now I'm going to be without my computer for at least two weeks. The trackpad cutting out seems like an issue a couple other users have had based on these reviews, and seeing as it is a problem that presents itself a week or so after it starts working again, I'm really concerned about their ability to resolve this for the long haul. Fingers crossed sending it in works, but these two issues raise some concern for me about the basic quality. I made the switch since Apple laptops have gotten ridiculously expensive, but I have not had these basic quality issues with a brand new computer before. It's still a great computer, but does raise some concern.	2	5	2	3	4
I bought this laptop at the beginning of my college semester and i've had it for about 7 months now. It was working really well at first, but after a few months, it started to freeze up more often. Whenever it does, my mouse wouldn't move, any keys i press don't make a difference, and it also produces this strange sound. I would have to restart it every time but its happening more frequently now. As I am a colle student, its essential to have a laptop to use so I'm beginning to think of ditching it and getting a new one from a different brand.	2	5	2	3	4
You can't beat the styling, battery life and performance for the price.I got this while I was learning how to program for school.I've been doing some photoshop(GIMP) with it as well as Blender and haven't had a problem. I play HoTS and Hearthstone on it all the time, and some Minecraft(playing Project ozone Lite right now with my wife).Has trouble running WoW but plays most games I throw at it just fine, Don't Starve and Factorio etc.Only down side is that I wished it had more ram.I'm learning Unity3D right now and the 8gb is kind of the bottleneck.	2	5	2	3	4
This computer has been such a disappointment. It looks beautiful and is extremely light and portable but it has caused nothing but trouble. Within a year I've had to replace the battery ( with little to no support from Asus despite multiple outreach). Keys regularly stick on the computer. It shuts off randomly and when on sleep mode, will frequently switch itself on and drain the battery over night. I've taken it to multiple people for check up and fixes and other than some serious hardware flaws, no one can quite figure out the problem.I'm quite gentle with my devices. I carry them in cases, I keep them clean and relatively dust free, I update my software including malware protection regularly but for whatever reason, this Asus has continued to be a let down.Not to mention absolutely zero customer service. I will be buying a new computer as soon as I can and not returning to Asus products again.Definitely worth it to just pay $300 more for a macbook air.	2	5	2	3	4
Light, fast, thin and good battery life.	2	5	2	3	4
Great. Fast laptop. Colors are great. Can handle the programs that were the biggest cpu hogs on my old laptop with ease.	3	1	5	8	3
I was shocked about how affordable this is for the specs it has. I love the color, the big screen, the 4 processors, the 1T of memory, and the 16gbs of RAM, but it's already having issues! It sometimes makes a strange, ear piercing, static noise and goes black and takes a while to restart, and from day 1, it easily overheats (even when it's over a hard surface).	3	1	5	8	3
Literally the best laptop I've ever owned the 16gb of DDR4 Ram and Quad-core processor makes it very fast at multiple demanding programs like Adobe Creative Suite applications, Sketch, and so much more. I'm happy so far with this machine, HP did a great job with this one.	3	1	5	8	3
"Graphics are awesome. However, the performance isn't always great. There are frequent updates that can take an hour to finish. When I've set the computer to update and shut down, it's gone on standby while updating multiple times. This means that the next time I want to use the computer, I try to turn it back on and it hasn't finished updating yet, so I can't use it right away. I'm trying to start working from home, so I need a computer that's more reliable than that.Loud fan, as others have commented. The product description when I bought it said that this has a ""quiet fan,"" which isn't true. Also, there have been times when the computer has struggled to perform when all I had open were some Chrome tabs and a Steam game. I didn't expect my game to have poor graphics and start lagging under those circumstances. Seems weird for something that claims to ""smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once.""Honestly, I wish I hadn't spent so much money on this. But I missed the return window, and it's better than nothing."	3	1	5	8	3
This is NOT the laptop pictured... the photos show a machine with a smart card reader and a docking station port... this machine has neither. The specs are right, but don't judge this by the photos.	3	1	5	8	3
Terrible battery life. Tons of RAM, but it’s really slow. Updates fail constantly.Disappointed for sure. I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone.	3	1	5	8	3
The noise from hard drive and cooling fan are too too loud on this HP. I could not take it. I returned it. Our other HP computers at home are very quite.	3	1	5	8	3
Horrible. Shut down, cursor is gone..no fix works. Where do I return on file a complaint? This is the work computer I have ever had	3	1	5	8	3
Bought this for my daughter. The only reason she says four instead of five stars is that she is using it for online classes and if she leaves closed for too long it shuts down. She has two young children gets interrupted often.	3	1	5	8	3
It’s been dependable for schoolwork. However it does glitch sometimes when trying to wake it up. Also the log in screen doesn’t always appear- which causes you to have to click one of the annoying advertisements in order to get the computer to respond.	3	1	5	8	3
Love this little laptop, and you can't beat it for the price. I purchased it as both a backup machine and to have some portability to work in warmer parts of my house during the winter months.I don't need a lot of bells and whistles on my laptops, and this Chromebook does everything I need it to. I am a writer and work all day on my computer; the keyboard is responsive enough without being oversensitive. I purchased a mouse to go with my Chromebook, but so far, I've just been using the trackpad, which is every bit as good as the one on my old Mac.The battery seems to last forever--I think I'm getting about eight hours out of mine, with multiple tabs open and streaming a few hours of video every day.The profile of the Chromebook is slim, and the machine feels very lightweight, yet it is substantial enough to hold on my lap without necessarily using a laptop desk.The screen's resolution is fine for my purposes, although the text size is smaller than what I've been used to, and I'm feeling a little eye strain. I need to see if I can adjust the settings to enlarge browser fonts. That said, most of my time of the Chromebook so far has been surfing the net; normally, I'd be on Google docs more, where presumably I could enlarge the font as needed. The glare-resistant screen makes it easy to work in front of a window. Also, this feature means I don't have to keep adjusting the screen angle when watching Netflix, for example, and changing my position on the sofa (I don't own a TV, so my computers are my entertainment). Fourteen inches seems to be the perfect size--anything smaller, and I think typing would be a challenge.This is a great machine for writing, Internet research and correspondence, and watching Netflix, Youtube, etc. The fanless model is of course quiet, but it still runs cool. I don't really miss a backlit keyboard (the only feature I wanted but couldn't get on my list of preferences), since I mostly type by touch anyway, and I never work in the complete dark. This is basically like having a faster, more comfortable tablet (ready to go in seconds) without having to install a bunch of apps (I'm fine running most things through my browser). I like the pared-down feeling of the Chromebook.So far, so good, and I'm very happy with the purchase. I've had good luck with HP products in the past, so fingers crossed.	3	1	0	0	4
We are very happy with the purchase of this Chromebook. My daughter was starting high school and she needed a laptop that she could do homework on nightly. Increasingly, she was using the family desktop or laptop for homework and my husband and I had to compete for computer time! We wanted a trusted name, good functionality and a good price. This was perfect! Now she has her own designated laptop and we didn't break the bank! No more fighting over computer time at our house. This fit the bill!	3	1	0	0	4
Bought this for our office computer which only needed to get emails and check backgrounds on the web. Would defiantly recommend for anyone wanting an inexpensive way to surf the web. It's like an Android tablet with a keyboard and large screen. I think this is an excellent value.	3	1	0	0	4
This is a wonderful laptop. Just open it up and start working. 10 hr battery life. Streams movies & TV shows great. Tip: Buy a Chromecast too, you won't be sorry. Just remember that to get the biggest bang from a Chromebook it must be connected to the internet. It seriously makes my 2 year old HP windows laptop feel like a dinosaur.	3	1	0	0	4
We've had this for about 2 or 3 months now. This is our first Chromebook to replace a regular PC Laptop, we've had several and they just don't seem to last more than a couple of years, they get slow, it seems like a lot of unecessary software. For our needs, just paying bills, surfing the internet, it seemed like this might be worth a try. So far we've been very satisfied, it's fast and slim. Knock on wood, hopefully it lasts a long time and we will forever be Chromebook people.	3	1	0	0	4

I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and I tried to do my best because I don't know much about computers. Luckily, it seems I did good. He loves it. It is fast, light weight, and has an HDMI connection which the last Chromebook he had did not.

Being a Google User the set up was a breeze. Within 10 minutes I had confirmed not only my Google Apps, but was also able to confirm my Netflix, Amazon, Comcast accounts all intact and ready to go.The audio is not as loud as reviews indicated. The keyboard will take a little time to get used too, but they all are. So far I am very pleased. Rate is 4 Stars only because I have only had the unit for a half hour.Even arrived a day earlier than stated.	3	1	0	0	4

I love this computer. It boots quickly, has no noisy fan, it's fast and easy to use. My husband has one too and we both love them. This is a simple computer for someone who loves to browse the web and download pictures. It took me a day or two to learn my way around on it, but now it's easy. All you do is sign in with your gmail address and you're on! Great price for a computer.	3	1	0	0	4

The Chromebook itself is lovely! My daughter loved it, however the display went off totally after 2 months of use and wouldn't ever come back on, so we had to return it.	3	1	0	0	4
I just started using this computer for school and after the 2nd use, the computer will not turn on at all!! For buying this laptop brand new, this is not acceptable!	3	1	0	0	4

Bought one last year I think and have been very pleased with it for just surfing the net. Only thing it did was once in a while it would power off in the middle of something, but i pressed the on key and it came back up. Hope this doesn't mean something might go wrong in the future. If it does, it's given me plenty of service for what i paid	3	1	0	0	4

2nd computer/laptop purchased on Amazon that right out of the box is defective. What is going on? This is very upsetting, never thought Amazon would sell defective technology,	3	1	0	0	4
My husband and I bought a pair of Chromebooks. It took all of 30 seconds to set these up before we were surfing the web. They are basic but that is all we were looking for. Browsing, shopping, banking, emailing, Youtubeing and facebooking. I had to Google how to right click because it only has a touch pad, no left or right click. I still haven't figured out how to copy and paste, but I haven't had a need so I am sure I can figure it out. It is a great product for basic use and the price is awesome!	3	1	0	0	4

Loved my first Chromebook so much, I had to buy this one for my wife since she was always borrowing mine instead of her Windows laptop LOL	3	1	0	0	4
The space bar barely works on far left side.No-wonder its only $200.	3	1	0	0	4
The computer itself functions just fine but the screen resolution isn't the best in bright spaces, the camera isn't great but it has a fww filters so that's pretty awesome, the battery life is very good it takes about 1 hour or 2 to get full charge if you start charging it with about 5% or 7% battery life, you can have quite a lot of pages open in the internet and it won't slow down, also the speakers are more than i expected for this price, they are pretty loud also the chromebook itself is made of plastic so it isn't heavy but the fact that it's plastic doesn't make it look cheap. I would say this product is good for the price that it has, i would definetly recommend it for teens or for a laptop that you would just have for entertainment scince it doesn't include any microsoft programs. Please rate this review if you thought it was helpful, have a nice day.	3	1	0	0	4

"We purchased this laptop for our son to be able to connect to his homeschool website and perform the various activities expected of him on a daily basis.One of the biggest parts is the daily ""class connect"" sessions that uses JAVA software to connect him live to his teacher and fellow classmates. With all the research we did before purchase, it was never brought to our attention that Chrome 45 and later no longer support Java, thus making it impossible for him to log on everyday.Therefore we had to return this laptop so that we can repurchase one that does support JAVA, since it is such a critical part of his curriculum.Which was unfortunate, besides the problem stated above it seemed to be a perfect fit for us, him, and our wallet."	3	1	0	0	4

I am so disappointed with this product. To start with, it takes a very long time to connect to my wifi at home. I'm not sure why. At home we have an iMac and Macbook, which all start up immediately when turned on. This morning alone, I had to input my password four times in order for it to connect and it never happened. When it had connected during this week, the processing is very slow and takes a very long time, minutes, for each new tab to upload. I don't have that kind of time when a Mac gives me immediate service. I'm sending it back, not worrying about the cost of a Mac, and heading to the store to purchase a new one. I'm a HUGE fan of all things Google and was really wanting to fall in love with the Chrome Book. I'm so upset.	3	1	0	0	4
It's fast. It's clean. But I didn't know and didn't see anyone anywhere mention that with a chromebook, you can't download other browsers easily. I also don't like that there's not a caps lock button. Not used to that, and when I hit where it usually is, it brings up a google search box. The price is right and the quality is pretty good, but I don't like having google chrome as my browser overlord. Battery life is good though. And it's pretty lightweight.	3	1	0	0	4

I really dislike this operating system. It's not compatible with almost any apps. It's very difficult to print with and the app set up is annoying. It you're used to a windows computer, I wouldn't suggest getting this.	3	1	0	0	4
i'm in love with my chromebook!! arrived so fast! thank you so much:)	3	1	0	0	4
Buyer beware: this hunk of junk cannot skype. It has a camera, and it is 2016, so logic would suggest that it can, it cant. Chrome just doesn't allow it. I will be selling this at a loss and replacing with a full feature laptop. This should only be purchased for internet browsing.	3	1	0	0	4
