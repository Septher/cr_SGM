brilliant chromebook couldn't fault it, Slick slimline design gives it the characteristic of a MacBook at an affordable price, Would recommend it if you are a medium user it does a lot of function except for Microsoft office that you need to sideload in the Google chrome as an app with a subscription. All in all is a nice little book for not so advanced user.	1	1	4	0	1
Nice, lightweight laptop. This new laptop was packed well and is in great condition. No scratches or anything sticking out of the laptop as some other reviews have mentioned. Initial setup was super easy. I will use this for internet surfing, watching videos, creating and updating documents via Microsoft Office and maybe some games. I will update this review as I start to use it or if I encounter any issues or errors.	3	8	3	3	7
Extremely happy. It is light weight, very fast and has a long life battery. Well worth every penny and I was thinking about getting another because it is so portable. It does not have a dvd/cd player but for the price you can buy an external one.	3	0	2	0	1
PC was working fine until latest Windows update caused it to no longer boot properly. I have found that it is missing the standard recovery partition for cases such as this. Dell Support also shows that the warranty expired on April 30, 2018 despite only having purchased this in February 2018. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller.	3	8	0	2	7
Before I wrote down this review, I have used this laptop 3 weeks. Acer's Chromebook 14 has a few things to brag about: Its brushed-aluminum chassis and high-resolution display make it stand out among other affordable models, even if other features remain pretty basic.	3	0	2	0	1
Turned on the laptop; updated everything and suddenly started freezing... poor performance! It is not what is says in the descriptio. Laptop should have lasted at least 5 hours battery life when using HDD But unfortunately this one lasts not more than 2 hours. And as stated; brand new laptop; good Quality on hardware but software just sucks; freezes when you open media player and second simple software. Just hate it after a week of purchase.	3	8	3	2	9

Recently I have been on a tight budget and was looking for something very affordable. I decided to get the HP laptop. Basically because it has Windows and comes in a variety of colors. I received the laptop on a timely manner. I think it is very cute. Very beautiful color and design. I am pleased with the way it looks. It is compact but not too small. Very functional and comes with Windows 10 , Microsoft Word, and Excel. You basically can do anything.Overall I feel that this particular laptop is ideal for teens and young adults. Basically anyone if you want something a little different. I like it and so far no complaints!	0	1	4	0	9

I have had my computer only for a week now but so far so good. Windows 10 was a bit goofy setting up. I called Lenovo and they wanted about $70 to have someone help me finishing set everything up. I did a few reboots and was able to do it myself.I’m not 100% sure I would recommend this to a beginner computer user, but I think I would to a fearless computer user.Nice big screen and the keyboard has more on it (than my computer I am replacing) including 10 key pad. My previous computer had a very small computer and was very comfortable for me. This keyboard is a little more spread out so it may be more comfortable for a man’s hands.Anyway, does what I need it to do.	3	8	2	0	0
Packaging was fine and the box was neat with no dents. When I saw the item I was so excited. Unfortunately when I turned on the laptop, it was glitching out from the start. The audio was fine too. I was so disappointed. The look and feel of the laptop is great. Will be returning and ordering a replacement.	2	3	4	2	5
I had my original laptop (a Toshiba Satellite M505) since 2010 and it work well for everything I used it for. Then last month the second battery died along with the charger, so it was time to upgrade and after looking at all the options I choose the Dell Gaming laptop. I've had it for about a month now and so far, it has been a wonder to explore. The processing speed feels lightning quick compared to what I had and the quality of graphics is quite nice. I found the backlight for the keypad to be an amazing feature letting me type when its dark or hard to see well inside. I'm still learning about the other features and programs pre-installed but so far, they have shone usefulness (NVidia GeForce account, Xbox connection, Windows Defender, etc.). I should also talk about Windows 10, my original laptop started with Windows 7 and worked beautifully till they upgraded to Windows 10. It still ran well but certain programs and links to accounts simple got lost or could never connect. This laptop came with 10 so it has those bugs solved and most of the issues solved. Now for the big one: the gaming experience, was it good? Answer: yes, like I never have before! Playing on or offline, plugged-in or not gaming has never been so smooth for me. I joined steam ad installed Hollow Knight and it’s been a blast all the way. Battery life with last between 7 to 5 hours while gaming, and supposedly up to 15 hours when passive, unheard off for my previous laptop. As for the cons of this computer, not many but they are distinct. This laptop comes with a SD card slot, 3 USB ports, a LAN plug, and a HBMI port. It does have a DVD player, this can be a pro or con since there are no major moving parts inside to break or collect dust, but it means music discs ad movies will need to be on flash drives or you need to get a portable DVD player. The other major issue can be price, at 900 it can be pricey, though compared to other laptops with some of the same features it’s a good deal. So, in summary: Pros - great control, lightweight, good graphics, long battery life, useful built-in features and programs, solid-state hard drive with no moving parts, and strong compatibility with Windows 10. Cons - no DVD drive and soft keyboard along with a mid-range price tag. Overall, I have enjoyed the Dell experience and I have to say I love learning everything this computer has to offer.	3	8	0	3	9
I hate Windows 10 but I think this one you can change it to Windows 7 or 8; but I'm not sure yet because I haven't had the time to check and do that. This is a great looking laptop, great quality, and it's pretty light. Everything is great about this laptop except the speed. It's on the slow side. I got this when the price went down so I paid just under $200 bucks for this. It's worth it because main reason I bought this is because I have mobile WiFi and sometimes I need to take a 'smaller' laptop on the go.Smaller laptops like does not affect they keyboard size at all. It just eliminates all that extra space on the sides of the laptop that you really don't need. Totally great for on the go, and sometimes small enough to slip into your handbag if bag is big enough. Very nice laptop.	2	1	5	0	0

It's not bad of a simple web eccentric laptop for the price, you can't expect much performance if you look at the specs. For those having issues with windows update, you need to remove previous windows installations each major release. I was unable to install April's update after freeing up enough space I was able to get the system fully updated. Clearing the leftover update files and previous windows installs I have just under half of the drive left to do with what I please. Only other issue I've had so far was the Intel display driver when I plugged in an hdmi display the driver failed to work, restarting and unplugging the display didn't fix the issue. I had to uninstall the Intel driver software and download the latest from their site, after installing the newer driver everything worked just fine even the external display.	2	1	2	0	0

I have been looking for a budget gaming laptop so that I could play a couple of my games, since my old laptop can't really play games.After reading some reviews on amazon and some articles about gaming laptops, I decided to go with this laptop.When using the laptop for hours the keypad tends to get warm but it doesn't get hot to where it burns your fingers.I can agree that the audio isn't as great as my asus laptop. It sounds like it the voices are cracking when at high volume, but at low volume (roughly between 15-30) it sounds a lot better with the game audio adjustments.I bought the 1050 4gb and the graphics are great very high def and smooth. I can play all of my games at high settings. I play mostly RPGs so it is great to have smooth graphics.When running windows programs the texts can be blurry but going on the web and playing games everything is all HD.The battery life is great when using the web or watching movies, but when it comes to gaming it could honestly use some work. It would last about 1 hour to 1 and 1/2 hours when playing a game that requires a lot of power.Overall I'm happy with my purchase, and when I added an extra 8gb RAM everything got faster when loading and the battery life was boosted a bit.	3	8	0	3	9

I bought this as a gift for relative, he loves it, uses it everyday for work and at home. It is mostly plastic except for the lid cover but doesn’t look or feel cheap. The 8th gen CPU is really good as expected, the 1050 also allows to play most games at FHD set in mid quality but the display isn’t as bright as you’d like. My only complain would be the lack of an SSD that would definitely improve things but again, it’s understandable for the price. The good thing is you actually got an empty NVME M.2 SSD drive slot available in case you want to upgrade.	3	8	0	3	6

So far, this laptop has been worth every dollar spent on it. It has a few stutters here and there but nothing to complain or worry about. It comes with the GTX 1050 4gb card which is not the Ti version of this card.Only gave it 4 stars because I haven't tried gaming on it as yet but I'm sure it will power through almost any game you throw at it at medium to high settings and some times ultra.	3	8	0	3	7

"I purchased the 14"" Quad Core E2-6110 32GB L402W Model for $199. I needed a decent cheap work laptop and decided to purchase this. The unit comes with Windows 10 S pre-installed. The upgrade process is relatively easy and quick to Windows 10 Pro (which is available through the windows store). The OS update process afterwards is not so. After updating finally finished, the laptop preforms perfectly fine. Its really quite responsive, however by no means is it ""fast"". The built in eMMC 32GB drive will have about 9.8GB left after Windows upgrade/updates and Office install.Have not figured out how to redeem the Office subscription, but I have Office 365 Personal anyways, so that didnt matter to me. You may want to find out how, though.Located on the bottom of the unit is actually a 2.5 bay for adding a second hard drive. Please be aware that its designed for a slim type drive. A standard 2.5 in drive will NOT fit. You'll end up bending the SATA controller on the motherboard up if you try to shove it in there. The SD card reader on the side is also a small gripe. The SD card does NOT push in all the way. It sticks out about 3/4"" from the laptop. Was kind of disappointed with this but the 2.5 bay kinda makes up for it.I opened the bottom of the laptop to see if there may also be an additional RAM slot, which I did not find from just popping off the bottom cover. IF there is one, it could be on the other side. Windows states theres 1 of 2 slots being used but it could be wrong.The CPU heatsink, for some reason (at least with mine), has a bit of Thermal Paste on top of it, which then touches the bottom cover of the laptop. This causes that spot to get rather uncomfortably warm.All in all, its a perfectly decent laptop for basic functions. Would look into cloud storage as the 32GB model leaves little to no room, although documents would be fine to save to it."	2	1	5	0	0

I like the overall look and feel of the laptop, unfortunately it has quite a few problems.1. The keyboard is not level. The 'G' key is very obviously lower than the rest.2. It loses the D drive (my SD card) every 20 minutes, rendering it useless. And this laptop is not very useful without an SD card.3. The touchpad is great after reboot, but becomes jumpy after 20 minutes of use or so. It has happened many times when I am using the file explorer (with nearly disastrous results)It could have been a decent laptop, but I wouldn't know. Unfortunately these problems make the laptop unusable for me.Sadly it's not an isolated case. I have 4 Asus laptops sitting in my house right now. Three of them have similar issues with the touchpad, two of them have issues losing my D drive. The Zenbook I have has issues with GPU overheating (even though it has a fan). They all have features that impress me initially, but fatal flaws have kept them from being useful.So ASUS, please:* Keep the current configuration, perhaps with more HDD space* Keep the lightweight and good battery life* Fix the issue with sticky touchpad (I have accidentally deleted files so many times because of it)* USB3 thumb drives have to work (I have lost a whole drive worth of data because of it)* Overall better quality control* I am willing to pay more if you fix the above problems	2	1	5	0	0

Its decent. Worth the money. Could have had a better quality for the price but its adequate. Its a bit slow/glitchy when opening certain apps or windows which can be annoying but fast enough to do what i need it to with no major problems. I like the look as a whole and like the feel of the keyboard for the price. Dont like the feel of the mousepad or the mousepads left and right click. They suck. But i use a seperate mouse so no biggy. Its relatively quiet but not all the time. Battery life isnt as great as expected but its good enough for the price i suppose. Its lightwieght for its size so thats good. I like most everything about it but i dont love it. Id change a few things and add about 50 bucks to the price but thats just a personal preference/opinion. As far a laptops go, its a good computer for a price that wont break you. It does what i need it to do, and then some, with minor annoyances here and there but not to the point of it being something that would cause me to not recommend it. If you can find better for the same price or maybe just a little pricier, go for it. Im just glad to have a modern, working pc. Thanks.	3	8	6	2	1
Very disappointed with this device. I loved it at first but appears the hinge that connects the top to the keyboard is very cheap and easily torn. It also freezes completely on occasion and not sure what causes this problem. I am sending it in to be repaired and may request a refund.	2	3	4	2	5

Now I have to return this and find another laptop for tomorrow. The only good thing about this is Amazon customer service. They're the best.	2	1	5	0	0

My second purchase of the CP+ is working perfectly. I returned an open-box unit last week due to a hardware glitch that caused the display to flicker uncontrollably.After comparing the C302 and the CP+ head to head for a few days, I decided although both offered similar capabilities, this CP+ offered a very bright screen and loud audio, which older folks like me value more and more each year. I am anxious to use the Android apps and love the form factor and portability of this Samsung Chromebook Plus. Perhaps I will return and update my star-rating after I have used the apps and stylus. A backlit keyboard would make this chromebook perfect. I wonder if others feel the same way, and if so, why aren't vendors understanding this.	1	1	4	0	1

Works as advertised, bought it for my brother, and overall its running as it should. Some reviews made note that they got the 1050 instead of the 1050ti, but this one came with the -ti variant as displayed. His only issue with the computer is that the games dont run as well of the charger as they do on it, and that the headphone jack for this laptop is extremely loose. Not sure if poor quality or faulty, but regardless its a downside to buying this.	3	3	0	3	6

The look and feel of this laptop is great, the laptop boots fast, runs smoothly, the screen colors are ok, the keyboard feels sturdy and the trackpad works nice, the only issue I had so far is the additional software added to the os, it's very intrusive, the included antivirus is specially annoying, constantly crashing full screen apps for no good reason and windows is constantly downloading and installing unwanted apps. I would give five stars to this laptop if the included software were less annoying.	3	8	0	3	7

I purchased this laptop primarily for writing and research and so far I am very pleased with its performance. I installed 128 GB card so it covers all my needs for storage. Excellent portability is another reason I selected this Asus model. You quickly adapt to the size. Keyboard feels great and the battery life is fantastic as stated in many other reviews. Just be clear on what you want your laptop to be able to do and buy accordingly. For the performance I need and the price, this was the right choice for me.	2	1	5	0	0

I got this for 160 dollars during the Christmas season in the Amazon Warehouse Deals. I understood its limitations but understood what I would use it for. It was for my 9 year old daughter to use to do her arts and crafts youtube stuff so she would stay off my expensive gaming laptop. It boots rather fast, windows 10 works just fine, and it runs youtube, surfs the web, and runs Netflix for the kids just fine. Understand its limitations and you will be just fine, expect more and you will be disappointed. I am extremely happy with it and the price I paid. Great starter laptop.	2	1	5	0	0

****UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE****I still really like this laptop, but a few issues have arisen that I wanted to mention. First, the laptop shuts off at 6% battery, not when it gets down to 0%, and then once it shuts off, I have to wait about 2-3 minutes after plugging it in for it to boot up. So that's really annoying, especially if I'm in the middle of something. Also, inexplicably, the brightness keys stopped working. These are not huge issues, but little annoyances on a laptop that's still quite new.*****Original Review Follows****I have been using this laptop for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it. It’s my first Windows laptop in a long time---I’ve been using Macs for quite a while---and this is really fantastic and feels like a big upgrade over my Macbook Pro.There are so many things I love about it, so I’m just going to go through them. The battery life is excellent. It’s very thin and light and sleek; basically it’s visually beautiful. I adore the touchscreen---I thought it was going to be kind of gimmicky but it’s super responsive and a nice feature. The speakers are amazing, and that’s probably where I see the most notable difference between this computer and my Macbook---the speakers and sound is just ridiculously good. Oh, and the facial recognition for login is a neat feature.The ports are decent; I personally find the lack of an HDMI port a little annoying but that might not be an issue for most people. That’s actually the only real negative for me, so if that’s not an issue for you, you might not have any negatives.I have to admit that having used a Mac for so long, I was a little worried about how I would find the Windows OS, but I found it really easy to pick up, and in just a few weeks I feel totally used to it. This computer is fast, responsive, and instinctive.I absolutely love this laptop and have no regrets for giving up my Macbook for it. Love, love, love it.	2	3	3	2	7
The purchase of a Surface laptop has been the most negative customer experience of my life. And I've dealt with banks and insurance companies.I bought the Laptop in early August and was happy at first, as it seemed like a good alternative to the MacBook / Pro. After about 45 days of light to no use, the laptop failed completely and tech support was unable to resolve, so refund / replacement was the only option.I thought about it and based on the news that had recently come out re Consumer Reports and the very high failure rate, I opted for refund, as my spidey sense told me this product had been rushed to market. I asked for a refund; as I was at 45 days vice 30, the request would have to be referred up for approval, response in 24-36 hours. Fine. A week goes by, nothing heard - I call, they advise 'your request has been denied.' Fine, I'll go with replacement, sell it on Kijiji, buy a MacBook. They send me ... a refurb. A highish end laptop fails after 45 days and MS believes a refurb is a fair trade. Now I'll have difficulty selling the laptop. I call back and say no way, not acceptable. They say 'just go in person into the store, they'll give you a brand new one.' The nearest store is 4 hours by car, can't do, have to do it via courier. They say 'We can't send a new laptop via courier, if you're genuinely not happy, ask for a refund'. I advise already tried, no success. They said, no, I'm looking at your file, a refund was never requested. So I waited for a week just to find out that first agent lied outright to me.Bottom line - I'm more than 2 weeks without a laptop, have spent in excess of 7 hours on the phone they consistently refuse to refer me to head office or any other level of customer support that might be able to authorize replacement with a new computer via courier. Apparently only Bill Gates himself could authorize such a thing, and he's busy. They have have ignored queries sent over email, Facebook and Twitter. This is what you can expect when your Surface fails.My sincere recommendation is buy a MacBook; the reliability is one thing, but the arrogance and ineffectiveness of MS customer service team is what makes me certain I WILL NEVER BUY A PIECE OF MS HARDWARE FOR ME OR MY FAMILY AGAIN. I've never had a major failure of an Apple desktop or laptop, when I've had issues with peripheral devices they have replaced even out of warranty.The product is not ready for market, the company is not willing to work with the poor suckers who got on early to try to find a good outcome. I will be buying a MacBook as soon as this circus is resolved.	2	3	3	2	8
"I really wanted to like this computer since it came loaded with a lot of good applications. I've worked with it for two weeks and the touchpad makes me crazy. It started out as not responsive at all and I had to hold everything down for several seconds to make it work. It got faster over time but there is still a huge lag compared to the touchpad on my 10 year old mac. On the left click side, there's a lag. But on the right click side it is too responsive so I was constantly clicking on things I did not want to click on. The curser just seemed to zoom all over the page. It was a cheap computer so maybe comparing it to a Macbook Pro touchpad is not fair - but I still expect a touch pad that doesn't make me want to scream. Not crazy about the ""Cortana' voice set up either. It took 10-15 minutes to set up what normally takes about 2-3 minutes on a Mac - part of that was the difficult touchpad. And this may be a windows issue, but I was constantly accidentally activating Cortana even though I turned her off. On the good side - I love how tight the serial ports are. No chance of them getting pulled out accidentally. I love the fact that you can drag and drop or copy like you can on all Macs. That may be the newer version of windows software, but it works very well. Came loaded with a PDF opener and many other things I normally have to download. Might be why the storage space was very limited. One other pet peeve every time I touched it, even with clean hands it left finger prints everywhere. It does boot up fast and the Edge browser works well. Very light computer as well, but feels sturdier than some others at this price range. I guess I will have to look at some of the more expensive Acers but will have to read even more reviews (than I already did) about their touchpads prior to buying. Hopefully, if I spend a little more I will get a touchpad that works much better and more storage. Maybe that's a higher level Acer, but we shall see. PS..the battery life was excellent and more than twice the time I get with my Mac."	2	1	2	0	0
I can buy 6 of these for the price of a Macbook. It isnt a Macbook, but really amazing at this price. The SSD HD is a bit small but if you store everything on the cloud or a thumb drive, you would be fine. The performance is amazingly good. No stalling or latency. and the best thing is that it is lightweight and screen resolution is great at this size. of course it isnt as nice as a Macbook or something at over $1000 but its close in more ways than you expect. The only thing i wish it had was a lit keyboard so its easier to see at night. but wow. and the battery life is great. I am done before its ready to quit. Windows still suck b/c they have frequent updates that take hours. and the user has no say in what goes in and when. If you don't need a workhorse (I use this to remote into my corp desktop since my Mac does not play well with Citrix)	2	1	5	0	0
"I have a couple of problems with this laptop so far. For one thing, the fan comes on very frequently and it runs very loudly. It comes on even while I'm just browsing the internet. In fact, it's blowing quite loudly right now as I write this review. The second issue I'm having with it is that the internet glitches occasionally and it'll freeze up. For instance, while I've been typing this review it froze up but I kept typing and about 7-8 seconds later it caught up with what I had typed...several times now (in less than 5 minutes). It can't be my internet provider, I very rarely had this happen to me on my previous Lenovo laptop.UPDATE: I bumped it up from 2 stars to 3 since I found out how to fix the slow browser issue. If anyone has a similar problem with Chrome on Windows 10, try this: Click the ""Customize and control Google Chrome"" button in the top right; go to ""Settings""; scroll down and select ""Show advanced options""; scroll way down and un-check ""Use hardware acceleration when available"". Haven't had a problem since."	3	8	0	3	9

There are many reviews out there that will tell you most of the intricacies of owning this computer, but there is a thing or two I did not see mentioned before so I would like to put it out for those few people who may find them important.To start politely, if you are looking for a laptop computer, you should seriously consider this one. It has all the potential you may want. It is just that it has limitations, too.First trivia about it is that the power button is located on the keyboard. It is between other buttons, not bigger and not smaller, just one of the buttons there. It is not even the one in the corner, it is the second one from the right in the top row. You will get used to it, but the choice of the position is unexpected, at least.Much more important to me is the fact that computer is practically barely usable unless you open the Microsoft Store account. It does not work straight from the box in the way computers should. Well, it will work with what comes preinstalled on it, but nothing else. A lot has been written about pros and deficiencies of Windows 10 S so I will skip those details, but you are not going to install anything on them without Microsoft Store account. Every review on every tech site will tell you that it qualifies for FREE upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and then you will be able to install programs the way you are used to with no limitations. Unfortunately, no website mentioned that Windows 10 Pro cannot be installed/upgraded to without Microsoft Store account. In case you thought that paying serious money to get a computer with operating system should be enough, you are out of your naïve luck. You will be able to meaningfully use that same computer only if you join the Microsoft Store club from which you may not have any intention to ever buy anything. Where is the rationale for asking gender and date of birth to open an account for upgrading to the operating system you were promised you would be able to easily upgrade to after you paid for the computer is open to discussion.Aside of that Apple-esque idea, I think the computer may be good for those who have Microsoft Store accounts and do not feel fooled by not being able to upgrade without joining the club. For the rest of us, it is a machine that could, but failed to deliver due to pre-installed software limitations.Please note, reviews of the new computer are not of the feel of the buttons or softness of the Alcantra only. They involve preintalled software and ability to use the item without having to jump through the unadvertised hoops.	2	3	3	2	7
Everything about this laptop is nice, except the keyboard. I normally type pretty fast, but on this keyboard if I type quickly it drops keys or even transposes keystrokes. Many times the shift key doesn't work. The only way the keyboard works correctly is if I type slowly and deliberately, which is ridiculous. I bought a cheap Amazon Basics USB keyboard and everything is fine now, but the laptop itself is worthless without a functioning keyboard!	3	8	3	2	9

WHAT A FANTASTIC LAPTOP ! All software loaded without any issues. It is blazing fast, and the back-lit keyboard is great.There are no issues at all. This was my initial assessment.After using this laptop for 3 weeks, I can say without a doubt that it is THE BEST laptop I have ever owned. It is super-fast. It boots quickly, and the programs load fast. The display is beautiful.	4	8	0	3	7
A steaming pile of garbage for the price it's out right now never connect to the Internet open Internet explore when I don't want it to is super glitchy and slow get viruses like every three weeks this is your only warning	3	8	3	2	9
I got this laptop for my online college and it works great. The mousepad allows for all functions (like right-click w 2-fingers or clicking the lower right button, it allows for double-tap, 1-click or left-button to select). I like the big screeb and the ability to flip it into tablet mode. The pen is really nice when I'm ready to take a break and do some adult coloring. And it's super light weight. I'm loving it! This is a great machine for the price... But if you are looking for something to do gaming or heavy-lifting dont expect this to do the trick.	2	2	2	0	9
I've had this for 13 days now, paid $650, and I am already having issues. The audio didn't sound great from the beginning, but now it sounds like static, and if I watch a video on youtube, netflix, or anywhere else, the audio and video do not go together. It is not an issue of wifi, I have been to several different locations, and nothing has helped. I watch videos everyday, for school and for leisure. I am so mad that this costed so much and works so badly.	3	3	3	2	6
This is an excellent little machine. I kept my eye on it for a while and watched the other reviews - if you're on the fence, and you're looking for an excellently light travel laptop that can run Office while you're on the road without breaking the bank, go for it. I'm impressed with the processing speed and the battery life is ridiculous - I ran all my updates/cleanup/installs of new apps and used it for about 3 hours a day for three days before it hit 20%. Keyboard and screen are decent quality for the price, and it handled all the uninstalling and Windows updating like a champ. Also, this is purely aesthetic, but in some of the other comments there were notes on the color...mine is definitely a light gold, no silver sheen. It looks classy, runs great,, and is so light I don't even know it's in my bag - perfect for long work trips. For the price and specs this is an excellent buy, and I am a happy Asus convert from the super-expensive and cheaply made HP options in this range.	2	1	5	0	0
It's touchscreen, it's lightweight, it runs Google Play apps, it's fairly fast, what's there not to like? I'm not sure if you can download everything from the web, but being able to go on all websites you can go on, on a PC and ALSO download mobile apps for this price range? VERY worth it. Even if it's labeled refurbished, it doesn't freeze like my windows 10 hp. Love it!	0	0	2	0	9
Piece of junk, don't buy! Cant update windows 1st week. 2nd week, keeps rebooting constantly. 2.5 weeks, won't even boot up anymore!!! No more HP, especially refurbished ones!!	4	8	6	0	2
Lightweight and has solid state drive which makes it start up super fast. I also like that the keyboard design helps keep it clean, My previous laptop accumulated all sorts of stuff between the keys. However it is a bit too sensitive for me and any small touch is interpreted as a movement. Also the battery life does not 6 hours as stated.	3	8	4	2	7
Absolutely perfect for our mobile business laptop. Quick, light, thin and error free. Quality is similar to Apple products.	2	3	3	2	5
After installing all of the updates and semi-configuring the laptop. I have an issue. The touchpad is terrible. It decides when it wants to allow you to right click or click anything. I don't always want to touch my screen to start an action. This is the WORST touchpad I've ever used on a laptop and I work in IT. My Huawei Matebook X touchpad responds when I decide to use it which is every time I'm using the computer. Changing the sensitivity doesn't help. I should never have to click on the touchpad more than once to bring up the right dialog menu or to launch a program. This is a disaster. I'm returning it.	2	3	3	2	8
"Overall very good laptop. This is a replacement for a Samsung laptop purchased in 2011.Pros: Build feels very solid and high quality. Has an optical drive, which I do still find useful and was looking for in this purchase. Laptop is not ""flashy"" at all in design--basic black, which is nice if you travel with it and don't want it to attract unwanted attention. Laptop stays cool. Plenty of storage. Screen is good, but contrast could be improved. This is the only laptop I found with every aux port I might need. (Recently spent two weeks in a location where a wired Ethernet connection was still needed to connect to internet). Very little bloatware. So far have found the fan to be quiet, so the laptop is usable in a classroom or business environment without embarrassment of the laptop ""revving.""Cons: The power/charging cord looks and feels extremely flimsy. Just waiting for the wires to break from flexing so much. Biggest problem with this laptop is not the laptop, but Windows 10. Was aware of that when purchasing. It would also make more sense if this ""business"" laptop came with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home version. The 1TB mechanical hard drive runs slow--no improvement in speed between this 2017 laptop and my old 2011. Again, a choice made to prioritize capacity over speed. Keyboard does not have backlight.Things to be aware of: This laptop comes with a trial version of Office 365. The full software is not included and must be purchased separately (or purchase a subscription). Default browser is Microsoft's Bing-powered Edge; IE 11 is onboard and can be set as the default. Windows 10 does not have a ""Windows Easy Transfer"" application, so a work-around or other options are needed if you wish to transfer files from an older laptop.Edit: Be aware that the speakers on this laptop are in the center of the BOTTOM of the unit. Sound quality seems fine as long as laptop is sitting on something."	3	8	3	2	9
I actually just bought my second one of these. I just got it fired up yesterday and loaded it with all my programs, so far so good. I bought one from the same seller earlier in the year but it was stolen while traveling. I liked the old one so much that I bought the exact same one again. Both times I got exactly what was listed on the specs and both computers showed very minimal wear, seemed almost like new.At this price I feel you kindof can't go wrong, and with all the money saved I just bought the 3 year protection plan so if something does go wrong Im covered.Like I said I only just got this one up and running up a couple days ago but so far so good. The other one I was using for 4 months while traveling in Asia with no problems before it was stolen.	1	3	4	2	7
Bought this as a Christmas gift. My girlfriend loves it. Fast boot up and easy set up. Graphics are amazing and its pretty fast with zero lag. Would give it 5 stars but it doesn't have touch screen. Otherwise a nice and very lite laptop.	4	9	3	2	4

I got mine at Costco about a week ago. So far it is everything I was looking for. I almost talked myself out of buying it because of all the gripes in the one star ratings here at Amazon. So far I've had none of the perpetual fan running, screeching innards or other cited failings that had nearly kept me from buying it. I have not attempted the fingerprint reader, having enough frustration with that on my Android phone. The only time I noticed the fan was when I was loading software. After that, the fan has been quiet or barely noticeable when it does run.I will admit that I'm not doing processor intensive work. I bought this mostly for a travel computer, and it appears to be ideal for that. It's slim, lightweight and the battery appears to hold a long enough charge that I won't need to haul the charger in my carry on bag, so I'm looking forward to a lighter load on future trips.Although my intention was for travel, as I'm getting used to using it, I'm finding I use it far more for every day work than the travel notebook that it replaced. Some of that is no doubt because of the beautiful display as well as the pleasure of using the accurate mouse pad and keyboard.	2	4	3	5	6
Had this for a couple of weeks and the jury is still out. It has some cool features but there are some things I miss about my Toshiba Chromebook.Pros:- Form factor - it's extremely thin- USB-C - has a USB C on each side for charging/connectivity. The nice thing is you can plug the charger in whichever side is convenient. Of - course no turning the connector over to figure out how it goes in - it's about time!- Android apps - this is the first Chromebook built from the bottom up to run Android apps. Now I can play Words with Friends and run most of my other apps as well.- Converts to tablet - this plus the fact that it runs Android apps makes it very convenient- Stylus - it's cool although I don't use it very often yet.- Bright screen with 4x3 ratio - the 4x3 ratio is actually more useful than the widescreen notebooks. Makes for more usable space.Cons:- No backlit keyboard - really? For a $400 Chromebook one would think this would be a given.- The keyboard - I can't put my finger on it but these keys are hard to get used to. Backspace key is too small and hard to hit (I make a lot of mistakes)- Trackpad - not very responsive. The tap to click doesn't work very well, not near as good as the Toshiba I traded in for this. This is one of the biggest cons to me because I use the trackpad all the time.- Android apps are buggy - Android support on Chromebooks is still in Beta status and it shows. Apps crash or don't display very well. It's the price you pay for being on the bleeding edge.- Speakers in the bottom - not sure what Samsung was thinking. Probably the worst place to put speakers. Volume is just barley adequate and completely inadequate in a loud room.Those are the high points. Overall it's a pretty good Chromebook it wouldn't hurt to have a little more horsepower which the Chromebook Pro should provide.	1	1	4	0	1
This laptop serves its purpose for me (emails, movies, surfing the web and simple word documents etc). The sound quality does suck tho; so get speakers. Love thr number pad on the side. Only issue I had was a brief scare with it acting up and wouldn't allow me to log in, gave me a blue screen. I thought it was over! I'm not super tech savy but still know my way around for a little above the basics so I managed to fiddle in the advanced options and got it back - phew! Hope it's not the start of something.	3	3	3	2	6

I've been using it for about 3 weeks and it has been okay thus far. It's my first Dell Laptop and with patience, I've gotten used to manually configuring settings (like changing default video graphics to make some of my software work well). Hence, if you can endure some research time to find out why somethings are not working well, then you could setup this laptop to its optima best to get the best out of it.As I noted above, I'm still getting used to it but it has been okay thus far.	3	8	0	3	9
I purchased this laptop for my wife as an early Christmas present. So far is has performed about as expected, with some slight surprises in speed.

I've never had any issue with any of their products.	2	1	5	0	0

I live in Hong Kong and this model is very expensive, so I bought it from Amazon. The international shipment by DHL is fast and safe, which I am very appreciated for it. This is my first time buying a laptop from international shipment, I am very satisfied for it. At first I always expect there would be some damage for the machine while shipping, obviously it is not. I have used the laptop almost 1 week, so far every things works normal and smooth, the experience while using the laptop is great. I use it for a little gaming, internet, and typing this comment in Amazon. The keyboard is great, the cooling system is powerful enough for the machine, sometimes a little bit too loud but not a big deal for me, the IPS panel is already good enough for my need. I have already replaced my desktop from it, just feel satisfied for what I have bought.	3	8	0	2	7
I love this computer for the most part, speakers aren't that loud and the fan can be loud, but my mouse pad won't work properly sometimes and my HDMI port doesn't work. Sound through the headphone jack is low too. I found out about the HDMI port not working while I tried hooking up my computer for a class presentation. I'll probably have to send my computer in to get fixed and once the mouse pad and HDMI port gets fixed then I'll update this review to 5 stars. This is a great computer for the most part, I think I just got a lemon. I'm not rough with my computer at all and I've never dropped it either.	2	8	3	3	7
"We purchased this laptop for our son to be able to connect to his homeschool website and perform the various activities expected of him on a daily basis.One of the biggest parts is the daily ""class connect"" sessions that uses JAVA software to connect him live to his teacher and fellow classmates. With all the research we did before purchase, it was never brought to our attention that Chrome 45 and later no longer support Java, thus making it impossible for him to log on everyday.Therefore we had to return this laptop so that we can repurchase one that does support JAVA, since it is such a critical part of his curriculum.Which was unfortunate, besides the problem stated above it seemed to be a perfect fit for us, him, and our wallet."	2	0	4	0	1

Good value under $700US. CPU chip and GFx can handle a lot. The 1TB HDD is cheap and slow so it really needs its OS installed on an SSD and at least 16GB RAM for heavy multitasking or gaming.

If you're looking for a computer that does anything besides basic stuff, you should look elsewhere. I use it only for writing and it works just fine. The computer is light and barely noticeable, durable (a necessity in my line of work), and has a long battery life. The casing feels a bit cheap, but can't complain because the reason I bought it is because my other laptop is so heavy. Basically, you get what you pay for; it does it's job for the price it is.	2	1	7	0	1

Arrived earlier than expected, the core i5 and GTX 1050 are a more than capable pairing. If all you want to do is play games like rocket league, csgo, league of legends, etc this will get the job done. Its not the best monitor in the world,(what did you really expect though) however It does have an HDMI port so you can find yourself a bigger and brighter monitor to hook it up to. The SSD is a bit slow but a couple screws underneath will let you have access to the internals where you can make your upgrades should your desire to. It's not overly big or bulky, it's pretty much perfect at least for me.	3	8	0	2	7

Pros:1. Runs games fine - a couple of frame drops every now and then but mostly everything is smooth. That 1060 Max-Q GPU will handle most current titles on playable settings but don't expect to max out your settings on the newest AAA titles.2. I've also used it to edit some short <10min videos and it handles that without much of a hiccup either.3. I've seen a few complaints about the screen but for my purposes, I've found it quite clear.4. Battery life is decent when not plugged in. I haven't tested how long it will last but i've used it for web browsing and YouTube unplugged and 3 hours later it still had around 50% battery life. I suspect it will get 6+ hours on light to moderate use.Cons:1. It's a little big and heavy so lugging it around for a long time isn't ideal.2. The keyboard isn't the best. But I use a Lenovo T-series for work so it might be a bad point of comparison.3. The bezelsaround the screen are around 2cm all around (close to an inch).All in all I can't fault it. Considering the price, this is a great laptop - possibly the best value for money at it's price point!	3	8	0	2	7

This is a very solid basic laptop which is good for playing e-sport games. Out of the box the machine has a pretty standard build of Windows 10 Home and the setup was flawless. It has some bloatware installed (think Candy Crush) and for better or worse it has Microsoft Office and McAfee Antivirus installed (but you need to buy license keys).The construction does not feel flimsy but the plastic build does not give a sense of durability. It feels like it will shatter if dropped. The machine is not light and the power brick is substantial. That said, it is not bad compared to a Windows gaming rig but it is a boat anchor compared to any modern Mac laptop. The keyboard is pleasantly responsive and nicely backlit but the extra lighting around WASD is annoying if you are watching a movie in a dark room. The display is surprisingly bright and vivid for watching 4K video. The trackpad, which is offset a bit to the left, is nice for one handed use. It is responsive and large enough to allow scrolling across the entire display in a single swipe.I tested the video card using Player Unknown's Battleground. It defaulted to medium to high settings and played smoothly at 60 frames per second. The card was able to comfortably drive an external monitor running a reasonably high resolution (1920x1080).My only gripe is the default power management. The throttling when the machine is unplugged is clearly noticeable. Download speeds drop by about 20 percent and the machine is noticeably slower for even common tasks like opening multiple instances of File Explorer. It can be fixed using the windows power management settings but in the hands of a novice (who does not know how to tweak windows) this machine will feel slow.I do not trust the feel of the construction on this in the hands of a 12 year old (or a clumsy 52 year old) but if you are looking for a budget gaming laptop and you don't mind carrying around the weight this is a good buy.	3	3	0	3	7
I've used this Chromebook for about 2 days now and wanted to pass along my first thoughts. Keep in mind, I currently own a 2016 Macbook Pro and had a Chromebook Pixel 2. I can tell you off the bat that this is no Chromebook Pixel (one of my favorite devices ever).I'm only giving this device 3 stars as of right now (being generous) because as Google has said.....the software is still in beta mode. From initial boot up, until today..... this thing has resets, freezes and other hiccups all over the place. I see the potential though so I'm not going to be harsh. I spent about 30 minutes composing a message that was suddenly lost due to a random re-boot. Wasn't thrilled.The screen is as beautiful as claimed. Touch sensitivity and quality up there with the Chromebook Pixel. I was pleasantly surprised. The touchpad has a great feel to it and is as responsive as almost any other Chromebook I've used. Still doesn't beat a Macbook glass touchpad though. (I know it's an unfair comparison)Keyboard is just OK with satisfying key travel....but wish it was a bit better. Other reviewers have claimed the keyboard to be a bit cramped which I can attest to. When typing away, the small changes to key size (tab, delete) become apparent and its just something you'll have to get used to. Not a deal breaker.Been getting about 8 hours of battery life. So far so good.Hope this helps with your research. My opinion, wait until the bugs are smoothed out. Maybe by the release of the Pro model (that all black look too) they'll have most of this corrected.I miss my Pixel.	1	1	4	0	1
INSANE! This is the 21st Century, isn't it? Dell and Amazon.com should be ashamed (yes you Amazon.com) for promoting such terrible products. The laptop is fine, I mean its a computer but what annoyed me is that I had to keep checking on the thing for almost 5 hours as it updated . . .?! If the computer is new, shouldn't the operating system and necessary programmes be up to date? Consumers only experience this inconvenience after the fact and are forced to tolerate it. SHAME on Dell and SHAME on Amazon.com!!!	3	9	3	3	9

Supposed to come with Office 365 for a year with no info on how to download it or log in to it. If you go to Microsoft's site, they want $99 for it. Seems very slow, and hangs up a lot. I'm gonna give it one day and if it doesn't respond like a laptop should it's going back. Also the HP support assistant pops up and hangs the computer.	4	8	6	0	2
Product is great until it fails the ne week after amazon return timed out. Then you go to Dell’s service and get to rebuild software multiple time and reboot even more often. The service is from a foreign land which will run you around until you give up!Bad Dell,bad Dell	3	8	3	1	4
I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it.It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it. I never thought about buying Refurbished, but now I'm sorry that I didn't do it before. I bought a new laptop at Best Buy and could have gotten a much better one that was refurbished for the price that I paid. Go REFURBISHED	3	0	2	0	1

Update: Do NOT be fooled by the great specs & great price, this is a horribly slow, unusable and now unreturnable piece of crap.Update2: Bad WiFi card, using an external and it works good. I updated to 3 stars from 1 because there is NO support and apparently no warranty, and a short return period. If you get a bad unit as others have implied, you’re basically screwed. I had to self-diagnose and repair it myself.	3	8	0	3	7
"The Ideapad 320 sells at ""Big Box"" stores for $199, and it does a good job at basic tasks such as taking notes in class, preparing Word documents, doing emails and watching Netflix. It does NOT have the power for games or video and photo editing.As with many Windows 10 computers in 2018, initial setup is a pain. It takes about 18 hours over a three day period to download and install an endless series of Windows 10 updates. Then, you must run the Lenovo software update program and install a new BIOS. And, finally, because of a Windows 10 ""bug"", you must disable the option to use a PIN code to sign into Windows because the PIN code sign in option locks the CPU at 100%, turning your computer into a paperweight. To fix the bug, you press F2 when start up begins. On the BIOS menu, go to the security page and press ""disable"" next to ""Intel PTT"" to turn off PIN code sign on. Restart the computer and sign in with your full Microsoft Windows password.Next, a Windows bug built-in to Microsoft Edge causes problems with long videos. Install the Chrome browser to watch Netflix and other videos.After setup is completed, the Ideapad 320 does a very good job for basic tasks. The non-glare screen is great for working on documents."	3	8	2	0	0

They lowered the price right after I bought it. No Matter what they would not refund my $50 back. I could have went with a gift card as well.And about the product. DON'T BUY IT. The battery barely runs for 3.5 hours if you use it lightly with better battery mode. On high performance it will die in 2 hour. If you play games it will die in less than an hour and half. Very bad battery. Slow responsive. Pc runs at over 50% for something simple like browsing the net. Wifi gets disconnected for a second in every 30-45 mins. I had search the net like a mad man to fix it, then gave up completely rebooted the new pc. Then it got fixed. Went through extra hassle for that. The customer service just told me to update the drivers, which it was already updates. They don't know anything. Clueless employees. I like the Screen and built quality I guess.I am never buying anything from Amazon ever again.	3	3	0	3	6
Don't buy this product. Only days after receiving I started having issues with the touchscreen. At this moment I need to have it shut off at all times, or it'll cause the screen to flicker or close tabs.	1	1	4	0	1
Overall it's a pretty good little computer. I like the small size, I can fit it easily in my purse. (I wouldn't describe my purse as small, but its not a huge one either. Just average size.) Good battery life. Nice monitor display. It doesn't have a lot of storage on it, so I would recommend an external hard drive with it. The computer itself also offers the option of uploading saved items to Google so you can retrieve them from any device. Doesn't have a lot of ram either, so it's not the greatest for running multiple programs at once. Ex. I was trying to listen to a video while playing a game of tetris. It got the job done, but it did struggle a bit so definitely not a gaming computer. The video by itself, minus the tetris game, had great playback however. That was Youtube, I haven't tried Netflix yet. It's a light weight, light use, one-thing-at-a-time device, which is all you can really expect from a $200 device. It looks and behaves a lot like a macbook, which is funny when you consider that apple would charge upwards of $1000 for a their version of the product, haha.	2	1	5	0	0

"TINY speakers with very poor volume - You can barely have a zoom call without headphones. Printing is a nightmare if your printer is not google chrome compatible. You can not save photo files from the web as .jpgs. Since it has no regular USD you need adaptors for every hard drive or external connection. The guy at best buy said ""A chrombook is not a computer, it is a glorified web browser"" and the longer I used it, the more I found that to be true. I would never ever buy a chromebook again, its just way too limited in what it can do."	1	1	4	0	1
Acer Aspire 1 a114-31-c4hh Notebook is a light weight, low cost laptop. Its dark charcoal carbonate body is slim and a reasonable size for portability versus yesteryear's models. The 14 inch screen displays an impressive high definition resolution. It has HDMI, USB 3.0 x1 and USB 2.0 x2 ports, headphone port, WiFi (2.4 Ghz and 5G), Bluetooth 4.0 and all the basics one would expect from recent laptops. It comes with 4 gigs of ram and a quad core Celeron N3450, is power efficient, and can bump up to a 2.2 Ghz speed when needed. The graphics, based on Intel technology, are exceptional. The sound-quality of the from the speakers are also impressive – loud, clear and articulated eliminating the need for a side device such as in-line Bluetooth speakers.Windows 10 comes installed on this model. I'm not a big fan of Windows and didn't expect much from its performance-wise (to say the least). That turned out incorrect. I found that Win10 was quite snappy for all basic computing -- office, surfing, streaming. It comes with some bloat like recommended programs and games, but once most of these were uninstalled I was left with about 12 gigs out the box of free hard drive space. Twelve gigs is not much too work with, but this device is designed as a notebook and not an full laptop. I therefore use an SD in for storage.The battery power is better than average, giving many hours of use and virtually no loss during sleep/standby. If this had a number pad, it may have scored higher with me in the office use experience (bad for number crunchers), but the keys are laid out comfortably with great space between each key. One notable deficit in this Acer, however, is very slow downloads over WiFi. I compared its download speeds via WiFi with those of other notebooks and computers in my home to the detriment of the Acer. Fortunately the Acer has a Ethernet I use for great speeds via that connection.I highly recommend this machine for professional types and people who want a reliable device that provides all the essentials of everyday computing need. I would rank it as a particularly good choice for those on a budget – it performs at the level of a more expensive machine. It's not for those who expect more internal space for	2	1	2	0	0

This laptop is a very powerful machine and a great value for all of the hardware features.Pros:powerful quad core amd 2.7 GHZ 2017 CPU with turbo boost up to 3.6 GHZ8 Gig DDR4 ram, expandable to 16 gig ddr4 ram1 TB hard driveUSB Type-C (future proof your household)2 USB 3.01 HDMIWebcamDVD-RW DriveBluetoothAC wifi (future proof your household)Thin and sturdy constructionRadeon R7 GPUCons:I have read that some folks expected a brighter screenBattery lasts a couple of hours of regular useI researched all of the specifications of this laptop, and I just was not able to get these awesome hardware specs without spending over $500. I was looking for at least a quad-core cpu, and at least 4 gigs of DDR4 ram. Usually laptops with 8 gigs of DDR4 ram are well over $500. Many budget laptops today still have DDR3 ram, and usually have 4 gigs of DDR3 ram. We might as well future proof our experience with USB Type-C, and AC wifi so our purchase isn't outdated for a couple of years at least. The 1 Terra-byte hard drive is more than enough space for a lifetime, but is also what is holding this laptop back. I went ahead and purchased an external HDD enclosure, and a Samsung evo 850 500 GB solid state hard drive. I transferred my data to the Samsung SSD, installed the SSD into the laptop, and reused the 1 terra-byte HDD which came in the laptop as an external 1 TB drive. This laptop completely starts and is all ready to be used in aproximately 2-3 seconds after pressing the ON button with the solid state drive. With the solid state drive, this machine is really comparable to other laptops which cost $800 and above. I have had my laptop only for about a month, and I love it so far! I am a student, and I primarily use my laptop for research and homework at school, but I also play some games on it too. I immediately purchased a soft neoprene case for this laptop, and put the laptop in the neoprene case, which goes into my padded backpack laptop pocket to protect my investment. This laptop is so powerful with awesome hardware that I thought about purchasing 2 of them because it's a steal. I'll report back in the future if I run into any issues, but I am extremely happy with my future proof and powerful laptop at this price!	3	8	7	1	2

I agree that the keyboard could be better. It's not 'bad' or 'awful'. It doesn't have a lot of travel and the keys do feel a bit 'cheap'.However, if you type a lot you'll have no problems at all.The machine is light, very attractive and thin.It's responsive and quick.I cannot speak to battery life as I've not run it flat yet.This machine is replacing an Acer C720 and I'm extremely pleased with it.Obviously with Chromebooks setting up is extremely simple.Running Android apps on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is very good. I realise there are some mixed experiences as some apps don't scale to the screen well. So far that's not been my experience. I guess it depends on the apps you're using.The screen is fantastic and the sound if very good. Given the limitations I'm quite happy with the volume. I don't expect bass on these devices so if you want a stronger bass, buy external speakers that have this capacity - you can't expect miracles.	1	1	4	0	1

Everything about this chromebook has been working super well. It is performing better than expected, particularly the (still in beta) android app support. High notes: The screen, the app support, ease of use, and the fact that it uses the same charger as my smartphone. Low notes: track pad is a little clunky (the touch screen more than makes up for this) and the speakers are quiet. Overall none of my complaints are anything more than superficial and I would recommend this chromebook to anyone.	1	1	4	0	1
So good I just bought another one. Fast, light, bright sharp screen, SSD makes boot up just a few seconds. Thin and great battery life averaging 8-10 hours of use between charges. That's about once every 3-4 days of casual use for me. The only improvement I can think of is to make the keys a little more curved instead of flat. But other than that, it's a perfect laptop. Does not come with a huge amount of bloatware that needs to be removed. The speakers are not too bad either.The Dell XPS 13 may be better but at $1300 compared to this one at $750, this one is a much better value.	2	3	4	2	5

I absolutely love my plus. I honestly can't think of a negative comment about it. Its excatly what I expected. I did hear about some problems with the touch screen but mine works perfectly. The speakers have some decent sound behind them for being bottom firing. I bought the Samsaung over the Asus solely because of this screen and wow it is pretty impressive. Bright and all the colors pop beautifully. The whites and very bright and the blacks are deep and dark. The battery charges in about 2ish hours (or at least thats when I noticed it was fully charged) and lasted on a full charge for about 5 days with basic usage like youtube videos and emails. I'm not very big on the gaming apps so I basicly use this thing as a laptop.I've only had my chromebook for about a month now so I'll check back in with another review.	1	1	4	0	1

"Excellent Alternative to Windows PCs...FINALLY!!! New, this is around $300, mine is ""Refurbished"" for $188. And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS. One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative). No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans! Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser. Google provides lifetime Free Virus Protection, An Entire Suite of Office Apps called Google Docs (no Outlook or MS Works needed...YAY!) plus Hundreds more Apps at No Charge!

"The kind of user I am: I live in the cloud, use almost all Google services, have been using a Chromebook Pixel as my primary work computer for about 3 years now. I have an Apple imac at home and a Windows laptop too, although I dont remember when last I turned on my windows laptop. Oh, and I know a thing or 2 about consumer electronics from a past job.For a user like me, this chromebook is *almost* perfect. If I could, I would give it 4.6 stars. You'll find from the other reviews the pros and cons described more comprehensively, I'll just focus on a few things:*** The cons I kind of disagree with ***- hardware ""bugs"" (e.g. speaker cracking, etc): I haven't personally experienced any of them. I do have one (super minor) issue with the sealing of the bottom aluminum sheet, so I just ordered a replacement, but honestly, at this stage I think I would rate the HW as top notch (given the price point)- Software ""bugs"" (e.g. android apps not always working perfectly...): I did experience a number of them... but I do not see that as an issue for 3 reasons. (1) the availability of (almost all) the Android apps I care about on this makes it effectively a wonderful tablet+laptop replacement, so in the grand scheme of things... I can live with a few bugs here and there (2) I trust that these bugs will disappear over time and (3) I have not yet found any ""critical"" bug for my work (/play) flows- keyboard ergonomics: agree it takes a bit to get used to the layout. given that I do use a full keyboard in parallel (when sitting at my desk I switch to a desktop keyboard), I am still sometimes hitting the wrong key when wanting to press backspace. But again, i see this as a very minor issue. Overall, the keyboard ergonomics are top notch given the size- backlighting of keyboard (lacks it): I was bummed about that initially (I often work in the dark). In practice, this is NOT an issue I have: the keys are sufficiently reflective and the screen sufficiently bright (at the right angle) that I can type effortlessly in the dark. I am typing this review in pitch dark room with screen brightness at 3 and I can effortlessly read all of the keys*** my cons or why I would give it 4.6 and not 5 ***- the trackpad is good (should I say great) but not perfect. I am expecting a stellar trackpad. This is almost but not it.- the speakers are weak. works totally fine, but I want more- the screen bezels are too large: the display is AMAZING, now I want more of it in the same form factor. In particular, at the bottom of the screen, there is currently 1 inch of vertical space (the part where the Samsung logo sits) that screams for becoming part of the actual display*** my pros or why I give it such a high rating ***They got the basics right: battery life is stellar, screen is stellar, size/weight top notch, keyboard very comfortable, trackpad works really well, it is appropriately powered, the memory and storage are sufficient to just not have to think about it.It is truly a convertible that is replacing 2 devices (laptop & tablet) without making compromises I can't live without). I LOVE this.Their bells and whistles actually help! microsd port is great to have, and so is the stylus (I thought of it as gimmicky, but I actually use it almost every day)price point is really good for that kind of quality"	1	1	4	0	1

"I am experiencing the same ""phantom touch"" issue other 1 star reviewers are explaining, despite nothing touching the touch screen whatever is open will periodically be clicked, dragged, resized, etc completely ruining the usability of the laptop. None of this happened when I first got the chromebook, it showed up about a year and a week after the date of purchase (1 week out of warranty.) Customer support ran me through updates, powerwash & recovery to no avail and pointed me to third party company licensed to service samsung products, for a hefty price of course."	1	1	4	0	1
Starting out, it was great. After about 6 months, it started to run out of space. It didn’t make any sense to me. I don’t store ANYTHING on this laptop. I keep everything on an external hard drive. Only thing I downloaded was a video editing software and Google Chrome. So I reset it back to factory settings to get rid of everything. A month later, running out of storage space. I’ve reset it and still runs out quickly. Now that it needs to update Windows, it needs more room to add the program. It needs more space than is possible. I’ve reset this damn laptop to factory setting so many times jut to keep it from having updates requires pop up. Even if I reset it to factory setting and NOTHING is on it, there still isn’t enough room available to update. I hate this stupid thing. I wish I never bought it.	2	1	2	0	0

This is a pretty solid laptop. I purchased it about a week ago and it has performed above/beyond my expectations. I switched to this laptop from a Toshiba Satellite, which had such a low processing power that it took an hour for chrome to open. This has an i7 processor which keeps its speeds crisp and quick. To make things easy, I will outline the pros:1. Fast, good processing2. Back-lit Keyboard3. Lightweight, Portable4. Excellent USB Port Access (3 of them)5. Crisp, Vibrant Screen Resolution6. Reasonable Battery Life for a laptop of this size, price rangeThere are a few cons though, but they aren't significant enough for me to lower my rating.1. No CD drive - but this is something I understand since most laptops are made without them nowadays.2. I noticed that removing/inserting anything USB-related is a bit cumbersome. The ports seem a bit too tight for accomadation3. Poor Webcam: the built-in webcam is grainy and is low quality.Thus far, everything else seems pretty good. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. We'll see how well this laptop works over the next few months to years. I will edit this review accordingly.	3	8	4	2	7
On time, as promised, in a sealed manufacturer's box. Well done. The laptop is nice, although you need to do the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro in order to be able to run normal (non-app store) apps.	2	3	3	2	7

This along with the solid-state hard drive makes it 100% silent which is really awesome!While the charger is legitimately bulky (as many other reviews say), its not nearly enough of a set-back to prevent me from giving it 5 stars!	3	3	0	3	7
I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement. I hope I can update my review with a better score when I get the replacement,=== Update ===I got a replacement. The new one looks okay. At least, there are no big gaps or exposed wires.	2	3	4	2	5

Started up right away instead of making me wait for it to update. No bloatware. None of the minor irritants I have had with other new PCs. Boots fast, so far no issues. I wanted the 2Tmemory for photos, and love that I have room to grow. It is fast enough for the few games I play. No issues.	3	9	3	2	6

"I've had a lot of computers, and this might be my favorite. The screen is flawless - bright and high-resolution. The stylus is a little cramped, but very responsive and pressure sensitivity is dead-on (I'm typically using Infinite Painter for drawing, which works great). A little too heavy for use as a true tablet or e-reader, but it's easy to put in ""easel mode"" on my lap to do drawing or play some games. Performance is so-so - definitely keeps up with multiple browser tabs and fairly intensive Android apps, but it's just a little pokey all the time. For a couple hundred dollars more, you can get the Pro version, which ought to be a lot peppier. But I got this as a second computer, and I don't need high performance. Also, if you're dubious about Chromebooks, I can only say that I have run into very few situations where it can't do what I want, thanks to having full access to both the Chrome and Android app stores.Does this have flaws? Absolutely. Keyboard feels nice but is laid out weirdly, build quality is a little haphazard with a decidedly plasticy feel to joints (you will NOT mistake this for a MacBook), but the sum total exceeds the value of the individual parts."	1	1	4	0	1

First let me say that I spent time trying to find exactly what I was looking for. I was nervous about the restocking fees at Amazon if I wasn't happy with it, so the decision weighed heavy. I have an 11 year old that I was looking for a computer for. I wanted something smaller than a regular laptop so it would be the right size for him. I also, since he is 11, did not want to spend a great deal of money. Funnily enough, I could find many 15.6 inch laptops for around $200, but anything smaller fell into the ones that could twist around and become tablets and such and were therefore crazy expensive. I tried the Lenovo Flex 3, but it only had 2GB of RAM and couldn't even load a webpage without spiking the memory to 100. So i saw this and reminded me of a Netbook. I was never really an anti-netbook person because I knew what they were for and what they weren't. So I bought this and used the Google extensions suggested in another review, and my son has been extremely happy with it. It loads every page he wants and allows him to type papers and such (I am using Google suite to save the limited space this has). Also, the size is perfect for him. So for under $200 with the 4GB of RAM, this has been exactly what I needed. If you want a multiple position one with a touchscreen, then this would not be for you, but still accept nothing short of 4GB of RAM and just know that you will pay more for those features.	2	1	5	0	0

This laptop is an amazing value. I am extremely pleased that I purchased this.Gaming: I have been playing Total War Rome 2 on ultra settings smoothly; it runs GTA V and Skyrim maxed out too. Recently I got into Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, which is gorgeous on this laptop.Work: I am also a college student, and this machine is amazing for that too. Its start up time and loading time for everything is very fast, the keyboard is crisp and responsive, and the keyboard lights up in case you need to work at night with no additional lights.Cons: when not plugged in the battery life is not amazing, maybe about ~2-2.5 hours typing a paper while listening to YouTube, but not terribly short.Overall: 5/5, would highly recommend.	3	8	0	2	7

Unfortunately, I bought this out of necessity and the ASUS reputation of quality. None of which is shown in the design nor function of this computer. The battery life is atrocious. The sound quality is laughable at best, pathetic in the least. The camera is non-usable. The idea that it has two hard drives is pathetic. Everything goes to the boot drive (128 ssd) without a clear way to download apps to the bigger 1tb drive that this comes with as well. It reminds me of when phones came with the ability to attach a micro sd card but nothing could go on it that had any importance. I am very unhappy with this product but I am stuck with it because I bought it before I started classes and now I am struck with a device that makes a Chromebook look like a gaming PC. This plus the enforced addition of Microsoft Edge makes this a pathetic excuse for a computer. The best advice I can give you is do not buy this piece of crap unless you have the money to buy a functioning computer because the moment you decide to upgrade this POS you will violate the warranty.	3	8	4	2	7

Best laptop for looks and performance. The fan is only noticeable when I put my ear up to it, even while living in Phoenix! It feels amazing to carry, especially for a student.The battery life is the best I've seen. WAY better than my Surface Pro 3. By the time I open the lid all the way, Windows Hello has already recognized me and logged me in with no wait time at all. The laptop is lightweight, and performs snappier than my Surface Pro 3 i7. The screen looks amazing, and the touch is incredible especially for how slim the screen is. The keyboard is surrounded by amazing fabric that is light on your wrists while typing (no it doesn't stink and hasn't changed colors) and the keys with 1.5 mm travel feel like a premium keyboard. I have loved this laptop for the week of using it for my junior year in college. Great purchase and well done Microsoft.	2	3	3	2	8

Well I got this laptop to download photos onto from Sd card cause I run a photograpy business on the side , It was hard hard to figure it out the 1st time ,plus It go's black for a few minutes at a time then comes back on , I got it cause it has a battery life of over 10 hours I do session all day long at the park for more the 8 hours the battery life will come in handy but if it continues to go black on me & also tells me it is running out of memory all ready WHAT a joke ,a waste of $ it is not even a month old yet ,I only use it to pay bills & play on FB !! and to download photos onto VERY disapointed I have had acers before & never had this issue & this is a brand new one not refurbished :( i wasted my $ again !!	2	1	2	0	0
Excellent buy. Ive own the laptop for over a month now with little to no complaints. I can only really complain about the low battery life(about 2-3 hours while gaming) and windows bloatware (personal issue). Ive been able to play the newest games on med- high settings. Would recommend this to others.	3	8	0	3	9
"I replaced my 6 pound i7 gaming laptop with this. Now, that's not to say this can do EVERYTHING an i7 with a gtx 1060 can do. But at two pounds and with a good 8 hours of battery life I can take it a lot more places, and do almost everything I used to do. Runs Chrome (obviously) like a champ, and will play most Android games as fast or faster than a phone or tablet. WIth full support for the Android store that also means you can run the Office apps, and more to get a little productivity in as well. Run it most often in ""tent"" mode when gaming, and that is more helpful than you might believe. The stylus support is als a much better deal than I had expected. It hasn't made an artist out of me, but it does make for more accurate selecting, and minimize fingerprints on the screen."	1	1	4	0	1

DOWNLOAD LINUX. Here's the deal, bought this for gf at xmas for school..at first it worked ok.. THEN the updates were released, the hardware/storage couldn't handle Etc.. it was rendered worthess..sad gf.. I installed Ubuntu linux for 100% free and ERASED windows. Runs GREAT!!! I have used it with multiple linux distros, all worked awesome. My preference is PARROT LINUX HOME. Beginners will like Mint or Ubuntu..btw Microsoft office equivalent comes free on linux.. Libre OfficeI never write reviews but took the time because I genuinely feel bad for the owners who dont know. Really, the laptop runs ubuntu linux excellent for most every day users, for the price, you will agree. Otherwise, its headed to the garbage... just back up your stuff and switch..dont be afraid to make the switch, linux is very easy to use and FAR better than mac or windows. Plus, you can run WINE for free, it enables windows apps on linux.. no brainer.Just type the words MINT LINUX into GoogleYou will be so happy! Greatly improved speed, picture clarity, wifi and battery is soooo much better.With windows 0 stars. With linux 5 stars!!PARENTS, check out linux for kids. FREEWant quicken and other book keeping apps for FREE? Check out GNU CASH, works awesome.Nerdy? Grab an RTL-SDR for $15 and listen to shortwave radio, satellite weather images, radio astronomyWe enjoy using the hdmi port to each hd movies on our TV.Laptop is seriously powerful now.Note to parents, gamers may be still be disappointed.. $100 laptop just isn't gonna make the cut graphics wise...tell them to read a book instead.	0	1	4	0	9
I was a little hesitant to buy a laptop online without trying it out in the store for a million reasons, but figured if I could return it for free, why the hell not give it a go.Pros: Display is nice, seems pretty sturdy, size is really great for students, battery life is good, it has 2 USBs instead of just one like most others, the keyboard has a nice feel to it, the weight is really light, it has bluetoothCons: The mouse is either too responsive and does a weird zoom and/or scroll thing (which i haven't figured out how to disable - I ended up getting a bluetooth one mouse instead), and the hard drive is smaller than I would like it to be.In all, I'm very happy with it. I think the value is definitely there for the money and it's nice to have something so easily portable that doesn't require a full-on computer bag.	2	1	5	0	0

Only have it two stars, mostly for style, not even two months owning this laptop and already faced slow performance with the hard drive causing most of the slow down in performance, not to mention they use a cheap drive for this laptop, being that it's a gamer laptop you would think they would use a much better hard drive built for gaming rather than an ordinary hard drive, anyways was very disappointed with this laptop even with all the tweaks that I used to supposedly stop the 100% disk usage issue, did not fix the problem as the performance issue came back a couple days later, in the end I just returned it for a refund and will just order next time with the components I want in a gaming laptop, at least I'll get what I pay for next time	3	8	0	3	7
Great laptop, it can run pretty much anything you throw at it in good quality. Just make sure you download gpu-z to check if your 1050ti is there mine was but the on board software only picks up the integrated graphics which gave me a bit of a scare. All in all fantastic purchase and would 100% recommend to anybody trying to game on a budget.	3	3	0	3	6
Flimsy charger. Broken in few weeks. ASUS does not sell replacement. They suggest that I should buy generic one. Device is still under warranty. Debating whether to go through trouble of getting a new one (or a replacement) and reinstalling everything or just buy a charger. Some consolation- ASUS customer service says generic charger wont void warranty on device.For anyone interested in buying, the status is same for battery! No replacement part!Unfortunate, because it is a good laptop. Poor after-sale support kills brands......	3	8	3	2	9
"This is a great price point for an i7 with an SSD. I was a little surprised a machine described as ""Business Flagship Dell"" came with Windows 10 Home. I now have to install Windows 10 Professional to be able to join it to our Active Directory Domain.It is very ""plasticy"" which is to be expected at this price. I own an M3800 and M4800 and this does not compare in aesthetics but more than compensates for with speed."	3	3	3	2	9
I had to return the first one I receved becuase it stopped working a couple of days after I recieved it so that was a bummer. Second one has been perfectly flawless running Linux Mint tho. I needed a secondary laptop that would last 8+ hours for basic tasks like web browsing and writing and this fits that bill quite nicely. Already own a $1300 Gaming laptop but it only lasts 4 hours on basic tasks even with Nvidia Optimus on board.I switched over to Linux since 32gb is just NOT enough space for Windows partically if you get Major updates like the Fall Creators Update and the laptop was made before it even came out so you would have to reinstall using a brand new ISO from Microsoft but if you do you are going to lose the Acer software so I just said nope $200 is plenty for a Linux machine since I ain't running games and the like that require Windows. Linux handles everything I throw at it for what I use the laptop for.	2	1	2	0	0

This is my first chromebook and although I am still confused at how to get it to do some things that I've always done on Windows PC, I am impressed. This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I like that it turns on automatically when I open it. The packaging was plain but very secure and my laptop came without a scatch! I saw some others say they hadn't gotten a charging cable but I think they just missed it. You have to dig all the way to the bottom of the box, where there is smaller piece of cardboard separating the charging cable from the rest of the packaging. I almost missed it myself and was worried I would have to return. Overall, I really like it even though I'm new to chromebook.	3	0	2	0	1

"To start off, I was supposed to get a $200 gift card for the purchase of this item, which I didn't, and Amazon would not work with me regarding the promotion (which is the only reason I considered buying this laptop). I will not judge the actual item based on my poor experience with Amazon.This laptop is great. I took naturally to the touchscreen, but you can function on the laptop without the touchscreen (I realize some people do not like to ""ruin"" the screen). Some things may bother you though.NO CD ROM. I lucked out in that I could download all the previous apps I had, but if you require a CD, you will need to buy an external CD ROM drive to run the apps, and to burn CD's.ONLY 1 USB PORT. So I had to buy a splitter. Personally bought it to be able to use a mouse and keyboard, although I find it comfortable typing on the laptop's keyboard.Overall, I've had it for over a month and I love it. No major problems, very fast so long has you have a decent internet condition. I have a lot of apps and files that I transferred with no problem and the computer is still running great."	2	3	3	2	8

I have had this Chromebook for a little over a week now, and I must say that I am disappointed. First, let me state that the product itself is made of superb quality. The entire device is made of thin panels of aluminium, with the exception of the keyboard. However, my device came with ridiculous amount of flex within the bottom right side of the Chromebook. I figured this could be just mine, so getting a replacement could fix this. Secondly, the screen is great. It comes with the native resolution of 2400 by 1600, and can get as bright as 400 nits, which is beautifully amazing, BUT, I have found out that you cannot utilize this resolution due to the internal processing power being too week. It comes with Samsung's own ARM processor, which is a low voltage processor that would be better suited for a android tablet. Lastly, the most atrocious thing about this device is the keyboard. It is so godawful that I rather trash it and use this device in tablet mode only. The keys, for my sake at least, constantly got stuck and felt cheaper than a keyboard found on a sub $200 Chromebook.Pros--Good Build Quality-Best Screen I have seen on a Chromebook-2 in 1 functionality that works fairly wellCons-Terrible keyboard (seriously, I cannot stress enough on how bad it is)-ARM processor is weak and limits this device-$400 price tag is not justifiableAll in all, this device was very underwhelming to me. I have decided to return it. Thank the good Lord upstairs that Amazon is an amazing service that allows such actions.	1	1	4	0	1

"I debated with myself over the screen size; how small a screen could I live with? I also wanted it to be as light as possible. I opted for a larger screen, but I find that it's heavier than I wanted for my carry-around laptop so I could leave my bigger and very expensive MacBook Pro at home. In hindsight, I think I could live with a smaller screen, perhaps 12"".I also debated about the RAM and disk size. Disk size is actually far less important on a ChromeBook than it is on a Mac or PC. All your stuff is in the cloud. It only stores what you're working on at the moment on disk. You don't even have to copy files up/down. It does that in the background as you work with the Chrome apps like spreadsheets and documents. You don't even have to look at how much space is available on disk. I opted for 4GB RAM rather than 2GB, because the unit was still around $200. That's an unbelievable price compared to any Mac or PC.What I love about this ChromeBook is:- It sleeps and wakes instantly- Multiple people can log into their own accounts (with a Gmail login). I don't ever let anyone ""borrow"" my login.- Battery power seems to be infinite. As I use it, it lasts all day between charges.- It integrated with my Android phone so I don't have to type my password when I wake it. If the phone is connected on bluetooth and unlocked, you can just click your login photo. (This is optional.)- There's no system administration, no virus software needed.- Any work that I do on my Mac (or PC) are instantly available on the ChromeBook. No copying files to a USB, emailing to myself, or wondering where the latest version was. It's just there.- It's very secure. It's secure enough that I won't worry if it's lost or stolen. Everything is in the Google cloud. Nothing is stored on the device that can be recovered by a thief.For me, it's the perfect second/travel laptop. I still have my power user MacBook Pro for video and photo editing. This will do simple things like cropping photos, but it's not meant for heavy duty tasks. For 90% of people, this will do everything one needs.One note for Windows users is the one thing you'll have to learn is that everything is easier and simpler. It feels more like a smartphone with a big screen and full-size keyboard, exactly what I wanted."	3	2	2	0	9

I had just got the laptop yesterday from the mailing company and the laptop ran fine while I was using it by my parents house. When I got home it was like I had owned the laptop for 5 years and have several viruses and spyware on it. It took forever to start up during which time the fan got really loud. When the desktop finally came up it took forever for everything to start. Typing was delayed by at least 2 seconds. It became unbearable to use so I decided to wipe the hard drive clean and install a fresh copy of windows 10 64-bit. Of course I installed all of the necessary drivers. But then I notice while I was playing a movie that the sound was choppy I figured maybe it was the video file. I was wrong everything I played from any site or on the VLC player I installed every couple of minutes the sound would come off choppy for about 8-11 seconds. Now the other problem I noticed was the I was not getting the 5 GHz signal from the wireless options even though in the description it says that this laptop is wireless 802.11 b/g/n. I of reset my router and modem and still nothing. My iPhone and my wife's $250 Lenovo laptop which she has owned close to two years now runs faster than this laptop and can pick up the 5 GHz signal so I know its not a router issue. This is probably a factory defect or something. The laptop runs faster now that it has a fresh copy of windows installed but still sluggish for a new laptop and also the audio is choppy along with me not being able to pick up the 5 GHz signal from my Linksys router. I am highly disappointed in this product if you are looking for a laptop look elsewhere and save yourself the head ache. This is actually the 1st review I have ever written for a product I just had to express my disappointment.Update: I contacted HP about the wireless issue and it turns out that this model is not dual band so 5GHz will not show as a wireless option. You will have to purchase a wireless usb dual band adapter if you want the 5 GHz signal.	4	8	6	1	2

Amazing computer for the given price; there’s a coolboost system that you can turn on. If anyone plays overwatch; it runs on 70FPS with the power plugged in and roughly 50C-55C when running with coolboost on. If you’re the type to run multiple things in the background while playing games, then I would recommend a 16GB RAM. I found 8GB to be barely enough with only one application open at a time. It is heavier than I had expected to carry it around. If anyone wants to use it for classes and play games in-between, this is more than enough, as long as you don’t mind the weight of it.	3	3	0	3	6

So far I've been totally enjoying the experience on this laptop. It came with the parts needed to install an additional SSD or HDD which I bought separately and was more cost efficient might I add than buying the laptop with the 1TB HDD preinstalled. This laptop has not overheated and I have ran benchmark tests on this laptop as well as played for 6+ hours straight with games such as Lol, Dota 2, Overwatch, and Battlefront on full settings.Will give updates upon any change that takes place.	3	3	0	3	6

I've been a devoted Windows user since the early 90s. In parallel, and in counterpoint, I've also cycled through countless Windows laptops over the years, including Compaq, HP and Dell, and often been disappointed with the longevity of the machines. I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.Alas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.First of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?After several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund. From Microsoft, I expected much better.	2	3	3	2	8

As reviewed: i5-8520U, 8GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB FireCuda Hybrid DriveI am very happy with this little laptop. Now I'm a person who can't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens. I'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 21:9 monitors and regularly use both when I'm doing homework. I'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user. I needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so I started looking for a small laptop with decent specs. For me this laptop matched everything I needed at a reasonable price.The main selling points for me were:-Small portable size-1080p ips screen-Decent cpu-Traditional layout-Subjectively a nice lookOnce I got my hands on it I had some thoughts on it. I was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic. When I first started using it I wasn't sure I'd like the track pad, but in use I haven't noticed it at all, it's functioned exactly how I want it to. I consider the keyboard to be good, I'd prefer a more clicky experience but I can't fault anything about it. I feel fast and accurate typing on it. I installed Linux Mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking. The only feature that doesn't work on Mint is the fingerprint scanner. The hybrid drive is tolerable, not as quick as an SSD but I'm not bothered by it. The speakers have a decent sound for a laptop, albeit a higher max volume would be nice.In conclusion this laptop offered everything I wanted at a reasonable price. The functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks. If you're looking for a traditional laptop in this size I feel comfortable recommending it. I plan on updating this review if anything happens as time goes on to change my opinion of it.	2	8	3	3	7

I have purchased Dell products for many years because I require their ease of use and dependability. However, this model is the exception. It was slow from the beginning but on day 35 of the 30 day return policy it downshifted into low gear and now barely works at all. Will not respond to links and basic commands. Lesson learned: my next laptop will be an iPad!	3	7	4	0	0

I cannot stream Netflix or videos on this computer without it dropping the wi-fi signal. There must be something wrong with the wi-fi card. I know the problem isn’t with my internet service-I bought a Roku and that streams just fine. I bought this laptop when it when it first got listed on Amazon. I wish I had waited to see any reviews listed before buying it. Based on what customers are saying about it, I would not purchase it now.	3	8	6	2	9
I got worried after reading the reviews but my machine runs great. No problems so far, the price was great and I am happy with my purchase. I too did not get any info on the Microsoft365 suite but I stopped using it long ago. Open Office is free and works great.	4	8	6	0	2

I ordered mine refurbished (Like-New) and might I say im quite impressed. Fast, no bloatware and beautiful sleek design. Only thing I didn't like was the ups gal leaves my package on the porch. Thank god I was pulling in as she were pulling out... That totally came out wrong. Ill update	3	8	6	2	9

First off, I read all the reviews. Some were good, some were bad. I thought that there were more good then bad so I decided to buy this. WORST MISTAKE EVER! The camera is busted. The “refurbished” is broken. They didn’t fix it right. I contacted the seller, and as you can guess, IM STUCK WITH THIS AND NOW HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW LAPTOP. People don’t care about warranties on their products	3	0	2	0	1

This is not as fast as a laptop but is completely functional for what I need it for. This is the 3rd one I have purchased. (the others were gifts) and I am very happy with the chromebook for what I needed it for. I use it mostly to update a blog, check emails, shop, etc. I love how thin and light it is.	0	0	4	0	0
"Dear Chromebook Plus, where have you been all my life...That basically sums it up, if you want more meat and potatoes read along! First I always qualify my reviews with some background info. Im a portable computing nut. My current (and recently retired) list includes Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, Dell Venue 11, Chuwi Hi12, Chuwi Hi 8, Chuwi Hi10 Plus, Samsung S2, HP Spectra 13"" 2in1, HP Spectre X2, Pavillion X2, etc. I've ping ponged all over the place trying to find the one to rule them all and Im coming to the conclusion it does not exist. My most recently retired machine was the Spectre X2 and the Chuwi Hi12, the Hi12 went to my daughter who basically uses it as a giant android tablet for netflix and simple games, The X2 went on ebay. The main issue with the X2 was weight, battery life, and charging system. When I do heavy lifting I always go for the Spectre laptop but I wanted something for when the laptop felt like overkill and the samsung S2 just wasn't up to the task. The X2 had mediocre battery life and only charged with the proprietary charger and also had a tendence to drain itself even while asleep if not plugged in at all times. More often then not this meant it got used less because I would forget to plug it in and it would be dead a day or two later, or I got tired of having to unplug it.I was never a Chromebook person, they seemeed too limited (yes I get thats the idea) but when I read about android being brought into the Chrome eco system it piqued my interest. The Flip was the first device of interest but the processor and screen were not what I wanted (I'm a lover of squarer aspect ratios). The Samsung piqued my interest again. Was it truly a tablet / hybrid device that was lightweight and portable enough for media consumption but also up to the task of occasional productivity work (excel, email, word documents)? Was it going to be powerful enough to be just enough when I don't want to get out my comparatively heavy and bulky laptop? Was it going to offer the all day battery life and ability to sleep without killing the battery nightly?I figured as a best buy elite member I have 45 days to find out! After about a week with the device though I can pretty much say its not going back. The screen is somehow one of the best I've used bar none, no need to qualify of ""at this price point"", this screen is exceptional. Bright, great uniformity, no bleed, and so so sharp. While it might seem a bit small by the measurement don't let that throw you off, the aspect ratio gives a much taller screen then you would have in a similar 16x9 laptop and it makes a massive improvement for my real world usage (reading PDFs, spreadsheets, etc.). Some people have complained about performance and I guess it's relative. So far I have found it to be completely acceptable given the price point, the battery life, and thermal envelope. Just tonight as I write this I have outlook (the android app) running, with spotify playing music in the background, a PDF open in Xodo (the android app not the chrome extension), chrome itself with 5 or 6 tabs open including gmail and facebook and the machine is still keeping up with my typing of this review. So for me that would be pretty typical use and its handled it swimmingly. The word processor app does respond a little slower with the android stuff in the background but everything still hums along at a decent pace.I also love that the machine is not just silent, it also runs cool. I've now had 4 Core M devices of various speeds and in tablets of various sizes, even when they run silent they can get uncomfortably warm (looking at you Surface Pro, Dell Venue, and X2). AGain its not the end of the world but its not ideal and once those chips start thermal throttling its debateable if you are actually getting your moneys worth from those chips. The chromebook here on other hand stays within room temperature with no signs of heat build up. Yes Core M is going to be faster but Chrome OS is also very very lightweight and google seems to be more focused on the Arm platform as the lead for Chrome OS. I could be completely wrong once they finally ship it but I suspect the Pro model with Core M is going to have a lower run time, run hotter, and for most people be negligible in actual end user experience.The joys of an always there stylus.. I have styluses for my Hi12, my X2, and my Surface Pros (or did while I had them still). In just about every previous instance they never got used. Its too easy to leave them behind or forget to toss them in your messenger bag, just by simply being there all the time I am literally 10000000x more likely to use the stylus for PDF markup and note annotations. I can go from typing a report on the keyboard to scribbling and highlighting with the stylus in less then 10 seconds. Yes the active stylus on those other devices are technically better but the point is moot when you have to remember to pack them up and find a place to put them. Its the Camera phone vs SLR argument, yes, the SLR always takes the better photos, but the best camera is the camera you always have with you. The best stylus is the one you can effortless have with you and thats what Samsung has delivered here. It is pressure sensitive, theres a modest amount of lag but it will only feel OFF if you are used to a higher end implementation like on the Surface. The physical ""feel"" of it is actually pretty good, theres a ""roughness"" to it that makes your strokes and writing feel more grounded. I do miss hover over like you get with the active stylus but again, if this is the compromise to have an always there stylus that doesn't have batteries for anyone but the most art focused buyer I think its the better compromise.Andoid Apps - I've yet to have any that didn't work. A few light mobile games (for testing I swear), e-mail and pdf apps, spotify, the key apps I use all just work. I've also read (but havent really examined it myself) that some developers such as Adobe are now actually designing their android apps with the expectation they will be running them on Chromebooks as well. Either way, Chrome OS is powerful for web work and adding the android apps really lets you fill in some blank spaces.Arm Performance - Anyone can push these chips to the breaking point but I don't think those demands will be typical of your average daily user. As I mentioned earlier, Core M is not power without comrpomise, at least all the devices I have tried it in. I would love for Samsung to prove me wrong but with ChromeOS the OP1 Chip seems to fall into the just good enough category. 4k Youtube, no problem. 60fps Youtube? occasionally a dropped frame but this probably come more down to the software then what the chip is capable of and I wouldnt be surprised if they tightened up support for higher frame rate video sooner then later.As a tablet - Possibly the best android tablet made yet. When folded into tablet mode the screen bezel (the bottom one) is actually a good size to give you a place to hold a nice grip without placing your hand on the screen. If you were to try and hold it by the other side (the top) the bezel is much thinner giving you less surface are to grip if attempting one handed usage. The keys will go clicky clackety when folded up but the machine is smart enough to ignore the keyboard when in tablet model so its inconsequential. All the android apps Ive used have worked well enough and its just the best thing ever to get a full blown Chrome OS browser in a tablet form factor.Build Quality - I think its gorgeous, I don't know why some folks think it looks cheap. The hinge is nice and tight, stays in place and everything just feels solid. The build quality is right up there with my Hp Spectre laptop just in a smaller footprint and at a significantly lower weight. If anything the light weight aspect of the laptop might give it a ""cheap feel"" but thats just our brains associating light weight with being cheap/empty/plastic. Keyboard is okay, no backlight (oh well) and the plastic keys are a bit cheap feeling especially as compared to the rest of the machine build. Two usb ports (type c) which can be charged on either round out the build. I also love that while they recommend the 30 watt charger it will essentialy take power from almost any source over those type C ports, if you go low enough it will still charge while sleeping but warn you that theres not enough current coming in to use and charge at the same time. The HP X2 was such a pain in this regard, despite charging over USB Type C they lock it down with DRM to only allow charging over THEIR charger. Not only are they over priced, it just means having to pack up ONE more additional adapter and one more thing to keep track of. With the chromebook, it might go slow as dirt, but I Can literally charge it with the most basic phone charger if thats all I've got with me and that does happen on occasion.Ive been using the machine more then I expected and for far heavier duties then I expected. It wont ever retire my Windows laptop entirely, some really heavy spreadsheets (VBA, lots of forumulas) and other system admin and SQL work just aren't suited for the Chromebook but I find myself using the Chromebook primarily and the laptop for those fringe uses in a ratio I honestly did not expect. Highly recomended and if you are concerned about keeping it try to ind one locally at a store such as Best Buy where you would have the option to do an exchange easily enough."	1	1	4	0	1
What a flop! I bought this for my daughter for Christmas since she decided to go back to college. I bought this in November, gave it to her on Christmas, and the monitor was dead by January. Reached out to Lenovo to get warranty work done as this laptop comes with a 1 year warranty only to have the service tickets cancelled without notice.The computer and the customer service both STINK!	3	8	6	2	9

Can't believe you can't upgrade the memory. Stuck with 6gb. What is this, an apple product? Wouldn't have bought it if I knew this. Can't run Windows Mixed Reality due to insufficient memory. Only saving grace is it comes with a slim profile DVD burner.	4	8	3	1	6

This laptop is goood ! The processor is quite fast, it just takes a few seconds to load when the laptop is turned on. It has quite good storage space and the battery is enough for people who play games as well as work. It has a battery better than most of the gaming laptops. Keys are good. Don't expect the speakers to be excellent. The speakers create an echo. The display is good. Since it's a TN panel, you need to set the correct angle first, but once you're done with it, it's quite good. And for people who have lots of work on Skype or any other video calling app, the front camera is also good. Don't expect it to be as good as your phone's front cam, but in comparison to other webcams I've seen, you can call this one great. And yes the charging speed of this laptop is superb. People say it's too heavy and it's not slim, but does it really matter ?! The main thing is the performance, if the performance and processor is good, then your laptop can function well for years. I've done a lot of survey before buying this laptop (as it is my first laptop) and trust me you cant get a better laptop at this price (800$).	3	8	0	3	9
After 3 months will not power on. LED cycles through green, blue then flickers white/purple a couple of times. Left charging for 12 hours no change. Searching online shows several people have had the same issue, sending it in for repair appears to be the only way to get it to power back on - which is extremely frustrating given all the time wasted in trying to get it to work and lost through not having the device.Worked with a Samsung technician to try and get it to power-up - using ESC, Refresh, Power 3 key press. A flicker on the screen but no boot-up. Sending it in for repair....I advise people to NOT buy the Samsung Chromebook Plus	1	1	4	0	1
Came in right on time, packaged in a nice slim case that could double as a carrying case. Ultra light weight and booted right into set up. Battery has been working for over 4 hours off a full charge and continuous use. For a $200 computer I would recommend this to anyone wanting something to use on the move, or as a travel companion. Also to a elderly person looking for something simple to use. Built in speakers are plenty loud, screen is crisp and clear, and the keyboard is a compact layout without the 10 key on the right side. The keyboard is nicely centered and the mousepad is positioned where I won't accidentally click while typing. The only issue I could see anyone having is the processing speed, and if you are looking for a fast processor in this price bracket, you won't find it, so reevaluate what you want/need.	2	1	5	0	0

"Get it. Great price. You WILL need a USB drive with it, even to do the updates.Make sure you turn on the ""better performance"" option in the hardware policies (a quick google search will indicate what to do). I enabled my High Performance power plan to be aggressive on the CPU, but at maximum power savings for everything else. It has a plastic body, so even when putting the wifi card to maximum savings with minimal radio signals, it gets full signal.I remember the days when even high-end computers were plastic.

Overall for this price range I don’t think you can do much better. The FPS for rocket league, fortnite, and csgo are acceptable (above 60, 120ish for RL). I use it to watch videos/browse and play games when I’m traveling. I would buy it again.	3	3	0	3	6

I bought this laptop to decommission a Dall unit from 2012 which served me very well, also being a 15.6 inch. It was pretty difficult trying to find an all around good laptop that fit all my criteria but this one mostly does it all.Build - 80% of the body is a light sturdy plastic. The cover on the screen lid is a metal sheet that makes the lid pretty sturdy. I like the weight of it and it doesn't seem flimsy at all. It looks great and premium has a good selection of ports and a full size SD slot.Screen - I came from a 768p laptop which was the worst, so jumping to 1080p is an irreversible step I've taken. It's very vivid and colors aren't too saturated. The brightness is on the low side and would be nice if it could get about 20% brighter and it is a matte finish and gives very decent angles.Battery - My laptop is usually a desk queen, but I have tested the battery and it's decent. Light use would see about 6 hours of life and hard use would be closer to ~2 hours. The battery time estimate is erratic and sometimes seems inaccurate.Keyboard & Touchpad - So I was expecting to have to relearn a new keyboard but I guess since the main body is only slightly smaller than my last laptop so it's almost basically all the same spacing and everything. There is no function key lock which I seemed to take for granted previously but it's not a big deal. This keyboard is backlit and has 3 different levels of brightness, brightness 1 is enough for me so +1 to that. The keys aren't loose and typing on them is I think satisfying, they're somewhat quiet when pushed. People complain about how the power button is right next to the delete key, but for me personally I don't find this an issue at all.So the touch pad isn't good, your fingers don't slide over it easily, it grabs your finger basically.. really odd. It clicks great, but I won't be trying to use is at all. Would recommend a bluetooth mouse at all times. The fingerprint reader hasn't failed once.Processor & Speed - My model is the i7 7500U... It's basically an i5 7200U but with a .2Ghz quicker clock speed. Still dual core (bummer... thanks intel) and turbo boosts to 3.48Ghz. My base clock speed according to windows and also Intel's own driver software says 2.9Ghz. I wish I had gotten a model with an actual i7 instead of an i5 with an i7 badge. Fan noise is overall quiet until you run something that puts it at over 50% CPU usage but even still, it's manageable. Keep your power settings to 'Recommended' because 'High Performance' keeps it permanently turboboosted @ 3.48Ghz **The model with dedicated graphics would be worth it if you're more than a less than casual gamer.Wireless - Bluetooth is quick to reconnect a mouse when turning on the laptop. At the same spot my last laptop was, this one gets 'excellent' signal whereas my other one would get 'fair' to the sometimes 'good'.Speakers & Sound - So out of the box it doesn't sound good, neither do. You'll need to play music and then adjust the EQ to make it sound nice, but when you do it sounds as good as you can make it. My previous Dell laptop has the best speakers and the best EQ settings for headphones/speakers I've ever heard so I had to make lots of adjustments through the EQ of this laptop to make it sound as close as I can as my last computer. I got it pretty close but still not perfect, but I can live with it! The weird this is this computer comes with like 3 programs that control EQ which is very confusing, AND they all aren't mutually exclusive so they all build on each other. For this reason I recommend doing it though the 'ICEpower Audiowizard' program.	2	8	3	3	7

After my last HP laptop died, I purchased this one. So far I have absolutely no complaints. It is much lighter than my old laptop which I really like, as well as being a bit flatter. I would certainly recommend this laptop, even though I've only had it for about 2 months.	4	9	3	2	7

I bought this laptop (1TB,8 RAM,I5 ) a few weeks ago,shipped really fast!,when I got this laptop I encountered a problem on the disk hard drive, it was always about 100%, I spoke with Dell's customer service and their employee gave an excellent attitude and fixed the problem in a few seconds, the next problem I encountered was limitation of the fps when the computer is unplugged from power source, to solve this problem you need to download the Nvidia GeForce Experience and change the battrey boost to 60 fps,great laptop so far,can handle most of the games on ultra,also look cool and comfortable to use,I keep updating if anything new come out.	3	8	0	3	7

I bought this laptop at the beginning of 2018. It's a cheap, yet decent for the price, refurbished laptop. However, after I unboxed it, I found they hadn't set it for OOBE (Out Of Box Experience), which is how most computers are initially set, so you can customize some of the settings and create your user account. And, certain things didn't work, like the Start/Windows button. It was somewhat unusable in that state, so I did a complete reinstall of Windows. (Thankfully, I'm a computer tech by trade, and have already done this stuff plenty of times before.) Also, upgraded the memory from 4 to 8 GB. Not terrible to get apart and not too many screws to worry about. You pretty much just pry the plastic shell from the bottom to get to the electronics. Also, as a side note, the refurbisher slipped in a single half-sheet of paper explaining what was included with the laptop. Fine, but the part where they wrote that Microsoft Works, not Office, was the current productivity software was a bit of a head scratcher. Works had been discontinued in 2009. Not trying to be harsh, but I'm not sure what happened there. Despite that, the laptop looked and operated fine. But, if I weren't a tech, I can imagine the frustration I'd be going through.	3	7	5	0	0
I am very disappointed in the battery life. It runs down very easy!!	3	8	3	3	6
This is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways, and disappointed me in others. Part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old, now. It certainly feels outdated next to this thing! I'll start with the good.* The laptop is REALLY light. When the box came, my husband didn't believe there could really be a laptop inside. He thought I was joking when I told him that's what it was. Weight doesn't honestly matter to me that much because I don't tote my laptop around, but if weight's an issue for you -- I really can't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this.* It turns on fast. Really fast. It has the OS on a solid state drive, and then a terabyte drive for storage, and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast. This is a laptop that I'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly, because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode. It's that fast.* It packs a fair amount of power without the heat. I've tested it on both Overwatch and Minecraft, and while it won't do either of those games at their best graphics settings (or even near-best), it does run them, and runs them smoothly. Moreover, it does so without producing a lot of heat, which surprised me. I have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop, since I anticipate it's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements, but I'm not seeing a lot of heat issues, even without it.* I thought the whole 'thin bezel' thing was silly until I saw this laptop's screen. It really does make my old laptop's screen seem outdated and clunky.* The speakers are decent, for what they are. They don't have much of a bass, but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music I was listening to that impressed me. If you just want 'thump, thump, thump', they're not the speakers for you, But they might hold up okay, for music that has a little more than that going on.* Battery life was pretty decent. My roommate played Overwatch for hours on it and didn't realize that it wasn't plugged in.Now the bad:* This is the biggest concern I have with this laptop: The charger gets REALLY hot, and the wire itself seems flimsy. Between the hot charger and the flimsy wire, I'm expecting that my charger isn't going to last long. This isn't something I'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away, either.* It comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall, which is kindof a pain. I don't get why companies do this. Also, it tries to push McAfee on you. I don't know why companies do this, either.* The speakers, while decent, could be better. But I've been saying that about my laptops for years, and have yet to own one where they ARE better. Still, when my iPhone has better sound, it feels like there's room for improvement.* Given how light and thin it is, I'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case. It seems like it could get damaged too easily.	2	8	3	3	7
This is a great Windows laptop. I wish it had come with a little documentation (especially for how to take advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro), but Microsoft support was able to take care of that for me. It feels and performs great. I had ordered a Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 with an i7 processor, and that got too hot to comfortably use in my lap on the sofa. The Surface laptop is perfect for me.	2	3	3	2	8

This is a great little computer for the price. I found it to be running slowly after I installed Windows 10 so I bought a 32MB microchip for it. Now it moves along smartly. I miss having a touchscreen on my little travel computer - but the touch-pad works very well.	2	1	5	0	0

It does pretty much what was expected. It is a fine piece of hardware. Still not as versatile as a computer though, but does exactly what I thought it would. I really wish I could seamlessly use office and other apps on it.	1	1	4	0	1
This computer was very cheap because it was refurbished. It advertised free Microsoft 365 for a year. I was unable to get a hold of the seller to get the 365. My emails were left unanswered by the seller.The computer is very light in weight. It is also very slow!	2	1	7	0	1
"This computer may lack some of the bells and whistles of less affordable models, but it is a workhorse. We are using it as the engine of a small recording studio, and it is handling its responsibilities well, literally not missing a beat. While our other laptops are lazily surfing the web or reading emails, the ASUS keeps up with the processing required to transform analog sound into digital data, juggling Adobe products as if they were beachballs. Right now, it's got various pieces of hardware plugged into it, including headphones, a mixer, and a microphone, and there are still ports to spare.Setting up the machine was fast and straightforward, and it's mercifully free of the bloatware that is too often packaged with lower end laptops. I haven't had a chance to test out some of the features, like the long battery life (it hasn't left the studio), but I like the fact that ASUS has nailed so many of the details, especially the keyboard. Most laptop keyboards seem to be tacked on as an afterthought ""guess we need one of these too?"" not the case with this model, with a keyboard that is solid and comfortable.Here in Silicon Valley, you don't see a lot of people sitting in coffee bars with an ASUS propped up next to their double lattes. It's not the latest or most fashionable me-too accessory. But if you're beyond needing to show how cool you are and simply want a laptop that gets the job done, the ASUS is ideal."	3	8	3	2	9

This started out as a really nice product when I purchased it 5 months ago. But now it won't let me update Windows 10 (the notifications pop up several times a day and I have to go through several steps to get it off the screen). Constant messages that I don't have enough memory. All I have installed on this is anti-virus. Seems that each Windows update eats more memory, so that within just a few months, there's none left and no way (that I've found) to add more. And now it has started dropping Wi-Fi signal. This was a waste of my money and I'm very disappointed in it. Don't go 32 GB!Update! - Now 7 months since I purchaced this. I babied this to get as much out of it as I could. I finally purchased another (different brand) laptop and the same day - this one all but died. The background went black and the Microsoft Edge icon disappeared. I tried to restore this laptop to factory default, and there wasn't even enough memory left to do that! Wants me to delete more programs so it can use 8 GB - I don't even have 2 GB worth of pre-installed programs. DO NOT BUY!!!!	2	1	2	0	0
As a dedicated gaming laptop it's pretty decent, but has trouble on higher settings with more taxing games.As a laptop for any other use, it's not good.The battery life irks me the most about this, and I kick myself for jumping the gun on buying this without actually reading reviews. I can't get 4 hours out of a full charge with light tasks like web browsing or typing papers for class, and gaming kills the battery in a ridiculously short amount of time.The display also looks washed out and I cannot find any way to adjust the color or saturation.The build construction feels cheap, though not overly flimsy. Mold lines left on both halves give a sharp edge that needs taken off with an emery board or sandpaper.I enjoy the appearance of the keyboard but it's far overhyped for what it is, a laptop membrane keyboard.In the end it's a $900 laptop that has some decent hardware but fails in almost every other category.	3	8	0	2	7

Unless you're desperate for a cheap/decent spec computer, avoid this laptop like the plague. This computer is so poorly designed despite it being a budget computer. I've mostly been working on a PC tower, and it never occurred to me how important knowing when Capslock is on. Its really frustrating having to go into notepad, just to see if your typing in your password correctly.At the same time, I also really hate the laptop charger. It feels loose, and the charger will disconnect at the slightest touch. Even with my older laptops, I always knew it was making a snug fit. Not for this laptop.Those are my two biggest pet peeve that honestly would have been a dealbreaker if I had known prior.	3	8	1	3	9

Great full-featured Windows 10 laptop. it has pretty much any port you would want, including USB Type-C for future applications. I wish that it charged like my Asus Chromebook: with USB Type-C; but I would guess it's because it uses more power than the connection can supply. Right out of the box I had an application for it: I installed Kodi with my Plex Add-on, then connected it to my TV Via HDMI and I was running home movies via my Plex server in less than 20 minutes.Like with any OEM laptop, there is some bloatware to it. I uninstalled most of it. The year subscription to McAfee is a joke: go with Comodo if you want a quality security application.	3	8	4	2	7
I just got this computer so I won't say much here right now. But one thing I don't like is the promise of a 12 hour battery life. Mine can go from fully charged to dead in 6 hours. And it has taken 3 hours to fully charge up again. Not good.	2	3	4	2	5
Arrived on time. I activated Windows 10 successfully with the code at the back of the Laptop. Good quality for this price.	2	7	2	0	6
Received within the 2 day shipping like advertised. At first I was skeptical because I'd heard so much negativity about Windows 10. I must admit, I do like this new computer, love the backlit keyboard, ease of use. So far, I am very pleased with my new computer. My Windows 7 was not compatible for the work I do so it was time for an upgrade.	3	3	3	2	6
Absolutely useless. I bought this hoping to just be able to do simple word, excel and things of that nature, can't do any of them. Constantly freezes, unreliable and no product support.	3	8	3	2	9

Been using it for 1 month now. Pretty much for gaming and work (container-managed software dev, etc).From a gamer's perspective:Pro:- sharp display- 120hz refresh rate- smooth keyboard- fast CPU & GPUCons:- as expected - gets hot - a little too hot sometimes (depending on the game, I guess)- touchpad could be a little betterSuggestions - it would be great if the screen opened out to: 180 deg	3	8	0	5	7

Crappy stuff. Wireless connection is defective out of the box. I am on 50 Mbps up/down network. This one hardly gets to 1-2 Mbps download. Upload is 20 Mbps though. Reinstalling/updating the wireless adapter driver did not help. Anyway, that's a shame, returning it.	3	8	1	3	9
"I would have given this Chromebook 4 or 5 stars as in most respects it is stellar. I concur with all the praise: Superb screen, fast and smooth as long as you understand the limitations of the processor, great keyboard, beautiful finish. Android apps are good enough for now and Outlook which I use all the time is incredible, so Google is slowly moving in the right direction and will only get better - patience is the key.The speakers are VERY TINNY and weak. I have low expectations for a laptop but this machine gets the prize for low end. But I can live with them considering all the other high points.Where I (for now) give it the 2 stars is a glaring problem with the trackpad that others are begining to share online: Inconsistency with click and select and click and drag. I do A LOT of text editing on my CB so this is an essential function and works like a charm on my Acer C720.Is this just a temporary bug that will get fixed shortly or is it a hardware issue? I don't know as the product is still so new.Problem for me is that this is a feature that I use so much, that having it ""broken"" makes the machine basically unusable so unless I see a fix coming up in the next few days, will have to return it. Like I said, I see others talking about the same problem so not an isolated problem to my machine. Will most probably return it and wait for the pro to come out and see if the Trackpad issue has been resolved. Good luck if you decide to buy!"	1	1	4	0	1
I bought this as an emergency purchase, as it was finals week and I was low on funds. I needed something affordable that was able to do internet functions and basic MS office, and this fits wonderfully! It is also light and compact, making it a good choice if you want to take it with you for note-taking or working outside of home. As far as gaming, I've only run Terraria, but it handles it okay; there's just not a lot of free memory space to store much else.I ended up being frustrated with this computer for a bit due to Microsoft's massive GB requirements for updates, but was able to mitigate this by purchasing a 16GB USB Drive. It was tricky getting Microsoft to recognize that drive to accomplish the update (a problem on their end). Fortunately USB drives are affordable now.	2	1	5	0	0
Let me start by saying I’ve been an Apple-only user until recently. I use my MacBook Pro for work and my iPad when I’m traveling. I’ve been traveling more and more as of late, and I find that the iPad really can’t do everything I need. For the amount of time I spend on an airplane, I need a fully functional device capable of heavier lifting than the iPad. But for the amount of time I spend trekking through airports, I need a device that I can carry easily in my shoulder bag. The MacBook Pro starts to feel heavy when I’m on the long march between concourses. So I’ve been looking for a new computer that can replace both the iPad and the Mac, and I think Microsoft might have just created it.The Surface Laptop is very sleek. The fact that you can open it with one finger is super helpful for me as I’m often on the phone while on my computer, and now I can use one hand for each. I also like that they’ve made it with fabric rather than just all metal. Much nicer especially when it gets cold outside; no more cold fingers from the cold metal of my computer.What I like most though is that Microsoft has optimized this device for security. The Windows 10 S operating system is such a smart idea. How great to be able to go anywhere—in style!—and not have to worry about my computer being safe from viruses.I have to say, I’m becoming a convert. I never thought I’d leave Apple but I’m so impressed with what Microsoft is doing. First the Surface Studio and now the Surface Laptop…I guess we’re going to be a Windows household soon!	2	3	3	2	7
I just got my laptop today. This review is for the Asus 11.6 inch 4 RAM Quad-Core.I absolutely love the size and sleekness of the laptop! For the price, it runs amazingly. It's not the fastest computer I've ever worked on but there is no slowness or delay either. Being that this purchase also comes with a year of Microsoft Office included (Microsoft Word, Excel, etc) you can't beat the price. Purchase of that alone is over $100.The color is less gold than it appears in the photo, it's more of a champagne which I was even more pleased with.I work every day on a normal size desktop keyboard at work and this keyboard feels comfortable to me.Also, I tested streaming Netflix and there was no lag and the display looked great!Very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a small laptop for travel and a laptop for basic browsing, emails and spreadsheet and document use!	2	1	5	0	0
"I got this computer right after my old Lenovo crashed right before my final exams. I'm a college student and was looking for something functional, inexpensive, and durable. This is cheap, but neither durable nor functional for the most part. I've had it for about 4 months and I'm already looking for a replacement. It's incredibly slow for even the most basic things and it has next to no storage space for any apps, documents, programs, photos, etc. I have problems with ""blue screens"" now - it randomly shuts down and must restart because of an unspecified ""problem with my PC."" The speakers don't always work and the wireless driver (what allows me to connect to wifi) isn't always recognized so I don't have consistent internet. All in all, a very poorly designed product that is fairly useless."	2	1	5	0	0

Something is very wrong with the wireless adapter. I contacted customer service at Asus multiple times and have not received the help I need.	2	3	4	2	5
Absolutely disappointing. Ordered Used-Like NEW from Amazon Warehouse. The look and feel was good but the bad experience started with the first push of button. The Laptop got stuck between the windows start up screen and boot screen. It started restarting in an infinite loop as soon as the boot was completed. A quick google search showed this problem to be found on all the newer ASUS laptops. I absolutely needed the laptop to work as soon as I got it and ASUS failed my trust. Kudos and full marks to Amazon return process which was very supportive.	2	1	5	0	0
Good enough computer for what I need it for - mostly photography editing. Microsoft adds endless garbage to the system that needs to be removed along with their constant pop ups to buy apps, etc. They have a captive audience for their constant advertising. Get sick of all the constant bells and whistles from them. Wish I had realized that the keyboard does not light - major disappointment, but good enough aside from that.	3	8	3	2	4
Got this as a refurb for a non-geek client who just needs it to be a working tool...so far so good. I am loving ChromeOS, so easy to learn and support. Folks spend more time in browsers than anywhere else and having something that mostly lives in the cloud helps to avoid backup procedures, supports versioning of documents and is easy to support. Essentially, we're back to remote terminals...and it's a good thing.But none of that's about this Chromebook, which is pretty doggone nice. The regular old HDMI jack is a plus...though I think Chromebooks all ought to use the new USB/C standard for charging, like most this one doesn't...and the simple power plug is easy to insert...unlike say a directional microUSB. The battery lasts all day, it's quiet and fast...	0	0	4	0	0

I bought this Chromebook Plus for my niece for her high school graduation present, a year ago last Saturday. It was worth every penny, and then some! She isn't really a computer person, and was much more comfortable using her school's Chromebook and my old Acer P720 than her own laptop. So a Chromebook was the obvious choice for her, but there were so many to choose from, I spent alot of time researching them all. I chose the Samsung Chromebook Plus for her because it had everything she would need for her personal use and college needs. She loved it then, and she loves it now! A year of daily use, it is still going strong and it has served her well, at school and at home. Ease of use, built-in security and frequent updates made this the right choice for us. I would absolutely recommend the Samsung Chromebook Plus.	1	1	4	0	1
For a budget priced laptop you get a lot of bang for the buck. It wasn't loaded with tons of bloatware, either, which is a refreshing change. It's a Christmas gift so I opened it to configure it but hasn't been used on a daily basis yet. However, unless something unexpected happens it's a solid 5 stars for value (price to configuration).	3	8	7	1	2

I spent a good amount of time searching for a decent laptop. I was stuck between a Mac and an ASUS, I ended up going with this laptop...obviously.I was looking for a laptop with a lot of memory, I'm becoming a coder so I needed plenty of space for my applications and programs. This laptop has it's pros and cons, just like anything else does. I'll start with pros: the look of it is very nice and sleek I must say, space, of course, is a big plus to me, I really just love ASUS as a whole honestly. Cons: the battery life isn't as spectacular as I would think it would be, the speakers are not that great, although I stream it through my tv so that doesn't really matter too much. Sometimes, it will randomly freeze, not too long but long enough.Overall I will say it's a good computer and I'm pleased with it. So depending on what you are looking for in terms of use, I would suggest this one if it would suit your needs.	3	8	4	2	7

"I know we all don't like to read negative reviews because we want this product to be the ""one"" after hours of comparing and contrasting but based on our experience with this laptop, I must give it a ONE star. Usually I don't write reviews but this is extremely disappointing because I always saw Lenovo as a budget friendly quality product. We bought this laptop for simple tasks such as browsing for products on the web and create basic excel sheets. It did not happen without any frustration. It took forever for the laptop to operate. We were actually deciding between this Lenovo and the Acer Aspire but decided on this one due to the 8GB of RAM. It was a bad decision purchasing this laptop because the computer would freeze as if it was a 5 year old laptop. Websites took MINUTES to load completely and the same goes for opening any application.I do use a Lenovo tower at home and it is magnificent, I wish I can say the same about this Laptop."	3	8	7	1	2

This laptop exceeded my expectations. It is very light weight. I have carried it in my camera bag and did not even realize it was there. It is very fast. I can do Lightroom and Photoshop editing on it with ease. The 1 TB hard drive is plenty roomy. I have all 12,000 of my digital photos on it with plenty of room to spare. I only wish it had an SSD, but I can always add one later.I probably use this laptop 10-12 hours a day, every day and I have not had the first problem with it.	3	8	1	3	9

I just got the laptop today and have finally customized and installed everything I need on it (aside from all the games I want). I am a Computer Science major and avid PC game player so this laptop will be perfect for me. The laptop I had before this one was another ASUS ROG, I believe it was the GL551JM. It had Intel i7, GeForce GTX 960m, 1TB HDD, and 256GB SSD. So really the only upgrade I went for with a new laptop was the new processor, graphics card, and overall design. So far I love this design of the laptop, it feels very sturdy and comfortable and honestly it is quite sexy and slim. I was so happy when I took it out of the box. Another reason I upgraded laptops was because I had my previous one for about 3 years and the motherboard was giving out, the display wouldn't always turn on so I had to power on and off the laptop until it did. Occasionally the screen would have a glitch of pink lines coming up from the bottom of the screen. So it was in due time of getting a new laptop. I do hope this one will last longer than my last one, I will be sure to take extra care of this one too. It doesn't help that I commute back and forth from school with the laptop but this new one is slimmer and lighter than the last.	3	8	0	5	7
Was easy to set up, especially for a tech-challenged old man. I was expecting a half-inch thick instruction book but it's all done interactively. You power it up and follow the prompts. It took a half day to load everything; you have to be patient. It serves all my needs, shopping banking, etc. I don't do games or movies on it so I can't comment on its capabilities there. The default browser is Microsoft Edge; I managed to change it to IE11 which is easier for me. For the money, you can't go wrong. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.	3	8	2	0	0

My daughter was so looking forward to this Chromebook as it has a lot of great features. She really liked the touchscreen, the integrated stylus, and the convertible screen that can turn it into more of a tablet. We did learn that the OS is quite different than what we're used to but we figured it out okay. The downside: in less than two weeks she managed to crack the screen, which is glass. Didn't even take much to do it, either, but since it's the screen, it is not covered under the warranty. Since this is a higher end Chromebook, we looked into repairing it. They manage to make every manner of screen replacement that can be purchased online and installed on your own, except for this one. I called Samsung and it's basically the cost of the unit to get the screen repaired. If that weren't the case, I'd give it another star but making something that is basically disposable if anything happens to the screen is a bummer. So word of caution: get the extra warranty!! If for no other reason than to cover the potential (and likely if this is going to an elementary aged kiddo) screen cracks. As for us, we'll be replacing this with a regular laptop.	1	1	4	0	1

For a basic chromebook is the best you will ever find. It is so light and the design si beautiful. But if you are looking for a high performance machine, don't go for this one. I give it five star rate because it is a great computer if you are going to use it for the basic stuff.	1	1	4	0	1

Honestly this is the worst laptop I’ve ever purchased on Amazon.

I was surprised at the level of performance. I have had this about a month now. I bought it to replace a 6 year old laptop. I thought any purchase of a new laptop would be a little faster and it actually slower. I use it for emails, social media and checking bank and investment websites. I do have a home surveillance program with four cameras running constantly but I had this on my last laptop too.I cannot seem to view simple YouTube videos. If I do full screen, the video stops completely. All other videos just do that circling signal looking for something. Changing websites takes forever. It just blanks out for a while. It also has delayed responses if I click on a function.I didn't spend a lot which I was pleased with, but maybe I should have spent a little more.My internet speed is very fast.	3	8	2	0	1
Awesome laptop for a great price! One small complaint however with dell regarding dells help towards putting windows 7 on this machine...There are windows 7 drivers but the drivers available are incomplete. Dell customer support wanted me to pay money to get windows 7 on this laptop. I eventually found drivers that are compatible by gigabyte for the chipset. The processor is kaby lake and because of that smaller nano circuitry windows 7 should not be compatible. I installed Windows 7 without any updates , then installed as many drivers as I could and the graphics acceleration didn't work so I installed windows 7 sp1and finally everythijng worked! Awesome power. No glitchiness or instability.	3	8	0	3	7

Bought this so that the wife could have something to use to watch Netflix while I hogged the XBOX playing games. She loves it! It has decent sound from the stock speakers and the included s pen is really cool as well. Setup was a breeze and the Google app store has more options than a traditional pc. Battery life is actually a lot better than one would expect and lasts a coupleDays with moderate daily use. The option to use an additional storage using a micro as card isn't seen very often with chrome books. All in all I believe Samsung produced a stellar product with this one!	1	1	4	0	1

Who am I? I am a girl with small hands (this might be important) who is a college student that has changed studies from a heavy-software-dependent major (arch/design) to a book/textbook/writing-major (PR/econ). So I knew I wanted a laptop that is very lightweight and easy to handle in my hands whenever i have to move from place to place. I never failed to bump my old asus laptop and i loathed the feeling. Besides, almost everywhere you sit in college, desk space is scarce, especially in the classroom or everywhere else you sat that was not the dorm or library. And I hated having my old big screen asus notebook out in the open. So for my new studies, I decided to try a smaller laptop to ease my worries and troubles. It has been a year now and i love it... although i have the old version and my screen does turn black at weird times. (about 10 times so far)Who do i recommend this product to?I am recommending it to my brother who is about to start college with basic classes lined up. I never tried heavy software on this laptop so I am not sure what happens if you install it. I believe it has low capacity to handle the latter. This is for someone who doesn't mind the small screen size and keyboard, and personally, someone who doesn't want a heavy bulky laptop when you depend on writing, maybe reading, internet surfing, quick tasks, basic school-workload. This laptop is the sole definition of portable and you can move it from place to place with the confidence that it will never slip away from your hands. (i recommend getting a case also) It is also fairly responsive. Doesn't take long to load ...that is if you keep it simple.In my college courses, i see lots of students with big-screen computers like macs and hp's. I dont see it necessary when you are taking the classes in the liberal arts, business, core classes, etc. I even know people in the engineering and architecture classes who either want an extra small laptop for its ease or have one already. I've had this laptop for almost a year and when I was still in arch/design school I would only use my old big asus to handle the heavy software and use my small laptop for everything else. All i needed was a USB to connect both laptops with the information i always needed.Now i use my small asus for everything. The price is really nice too.FWI: this is the first review i've written in my life for a product. I just think this computer can really help out anybody whether you are a student, or professional.	2	1	5	0	0
Does everything I want. Great for typing and music or movies. Harder to draw with the stylus, but that is probably a low-skill issue on my part. Would really make a great tablet except I don't like my hands pressing the keys (even if they're deactivated in this mode). Has great battery life, too. Why would anyone pay more for windows?	1	1	4	0	1

Great laptop for the price. Very fast for what I use it for. Only downfall is that it doesn’t have an internal dvd/cd drive. Does come with Norton security that I recommend immediately changing. Norton didn’t load 6 or the first 12 times I turned the computer on. Since it is new and Windows updates regularly it will take several hours to update right out of the box.	3	8	3	2	6
I bought as a present for my father for Father’s Day and his birthday. Its lightweight and alot faster than our old one! So far so good! He only uses it to read news and maybe play a card game here or there but its perfect for him!	2	1	2	0	0
Did not work out of the box, the wifi would not connect to my home network that I have other devices connected to including a 10 year old Aceer Laptop which I love.Also note the Amazon/ Acer Customer Service experience was absolutely horrible, spoke to 5 different agents, reqeusted to speak to someone in the U.S. and would not transfer to level 2 support.My reccomendation is to NOT purchas any Acer items if you think you will require customer support.I think this is why Best Buy and other brick and mortor retailers have stopped carrying these products.	2	1	2	0	0
This laptop is my first gaming laptop and I love it. It runs very well with the help of intel i5. This game easily runs games like Overwatch at 60 fps and never crashes. The keyboard feels very nice and is very quiet. The backlit feature is very good-looking and lights up the keys just enough to see them in the dark. The cooling system can keep the temperature of the laptop down enough that it does not have any problems. This machine also has the ability for you to add an extra hard drive in case you need it. Screws are included in the box so that if you decide to buy another hard drive, you can install it right away. One problem that I do have that I have seen other people having is that my laptop will randomly shut off when not charging. I am not sure why this happens but I just though I should include this in my review. Otherwise, this laptop is a great buy for those who want an affordable laptop that can game and get work done. I highly recommend it and hope the buyers love it as well.	3	3	0	3	6

I am a gamer and this is NO gaming machine. I increased the turbo to the max 3.3 and FRPS maxed at 16, stutter, freezing, skipped scenes. This is not a gaming system at all. If you are looking for an inexpensive gaming laptop, this is not it. I purchased this as a more portable laptop than my ASUS w/ 64G Ram that weights 12 lbs and what a regrettable decision. My MacBook gets better FRPS than this machine does and it's 4 years old. The graphics card is junk and the screen is pixelated with outlined and bright around avatars and terrains. Do yourself a favor and save a little more cash and purchase a computer worth your hard earned money. The plastic casing and small fan also makes the fan run non-stop at running barely any low level game such as MineCraft, for example. I give this a - - - star actually as it took almost a whole minute to even open up a word document. Returning after trying to increase capabilities with no avail. Those leaving high end reviews, must never have had a decent laptop if they think this is actually a gaming machine.	3	8	6	2	9

The laptop was a great overall but been having issues with it the past week. I factory reset the laptop and update the bios, graphics card, and windows. Then it just shut down after starting a game on it. Tried force reset a few times didn't work. Replaced the dcin wire since it was burned out, still didn't work. Just had the computer one year it's dcin cable got burned out and the motherboard is short circuit.	3	3	0	3	7

I bought this as an upgrade replacement to a seven year-old Acer laptop and I'm not disappointed. The amount of manufacturer-install cruft was minimal - I had all the sales junk uninstalled in under an hour - and the SSD drive means it boots in seconds.My only complaints are that A. they made some questionable choices about the keyboard layout (the DEL / HOME / END combo got moved around to make way for a POWER button? Why on Earth?) and B. the exact same model is available for $400 from Acer's website minus the SSD, which is < $100 here on Amazon. So I ended up paying a $100 premium to have someone else to do the SSD drive and Windows install for me. I'm not overly broken up about that.	3	8	4	3	7

I bought this a month ago thinking it would solve our computing problems. It doesn't. Our printer works with our other computer. It will not work with the Chromebook.

I expected a computer that works well . This is not it.	3	0	2	0	1
Mine also had the Phantom Touchscreen issue beginning after about 4 months of use. Took it back to Best Buy, they sent it off, it came back in less than two weeks with a replaced screen and no charge because they deal with Samsung So I don't have to. So far so good with the fix.If you are in the US and are having issues, take it to Best Buy. They can help whether you purchased thru them or not.Other than that, it has been a great little machine!	1	1	4	0	1

BACKGROUNDI’m not that old but I got interested in computers early on. I was the first of my friends who owned a personal computer and one of the first owners of what could truly be called a laptop. Back then the name Dell conjured up an image of something kluged together in someone’s dorm room and it was years before I could take them seriously.Fast forward to today when I’ve owned so many PC’s I’ve lost count and my personal laptop is a large-screen Dell gaming machine that may be the most advanced laptop I’ve ever owned. Needless to say these days I have no issues when I hear someone say dude you’re getting a Dell.This one is at the edge of modern technology and thankfully for me has what it takes to use in my business in a much smaller and lighter form factor than my big Dell gaming laptop and as a bonus adds a touch screen, which to me is more than just a trivial nicety, as a graphic artist and pro photographer when combined with a PN338M active pen they are big selling points.OBSERVATIONSIt’s true that Dell laptops may not be carved from a single piece of aluminum and there is extensive use of plastics, but it all comes together to form a surprisingly well built and sturdy machine. The keys feel tight and accurate, the track pad that tends to be misunderstood if you don’t read how to customize it is better than average, and the 13.3” screen the ideal compromise between being big enough to be useful but small enough to keep the device small and portable - the entire laptop is not much larger than a sheet of paper and just over 3/4 inch thick.This laptop is the most lacking of status lights, switches or buttons I’ve ever seen. There is literally only one status light at the front edge that illuminates during charging or when the storage drive is accessing. The on/off switch is on the exterior side and is a push to activate button, which unfortunately could be pushed accidentally, especially if you store it in a soft laptop case. The only other button is an external rocker switch for the volume control. In terms of I/O ports my opinion is that what they have is adequate but not impressive but for me it’s all I need.SPECSAs far as specs, they speak for themselves, it runs my most intensive photo/video editing apps without hesitation (note that the stock 8GB RAM is easily user upgradable, which I upgraded to 16GB myself in a couple of minutes).DOWNSIDESOne thing is that at 3.5 pounds it’s not the lightest but I can forgive that because it does feel more rugged than some if the lighter models. Another is the lack of an optical drive which is simply a fact of life today and other than being a minor inconvenience for people like me who do graphics work I’d gladly give up the extra weight and use of space an internal optical drive would add.An observation that I wouldn’t exactly call a downside but definitely distorted is that they say it has a “sleek new design that emphasizes more screen and less bezel”. No that’s not true, what they’ve done is extend the glass that covers the screen all the way to the edge purely for cosmetics but under that glass is a totally normal 13.3” screen surrounded by large borders and a very thick border at the bottom. They had plenty of real estate to actually reduce the size of the bezel and use a larger screen – but they chose not to.Speaking of design, the entire design philosophy of this laptop is that it can be used in multiple configurations. That sounds really nice on paper but in real life use it turns out to be not all sunshine and rainbows. When used as a typical laptop (on your lap) the two audio speakers are on the bottom and face right into your lap, muffling the sound. Even when on a desktop the sound is muffled. And the fan, the value of which is questionable since my much larger Dell laptop doesn’t have one, and the one in this unit is weak, also faces downward into your lap. When you prop it up like an easel the keyboard faces downward on the desktop, supported by only four tiny rubber feet. The feet are all toward the top of the keyboard so if you press too hard when using the touchscreen the entire laptop rocks backward. When you use the laptop in a tent mode, there are no plastic or rubber feet along the edge that sits on the desktop (the front edge that faces you when used as a normal laptop). This doesn’t cause any major problems except that that painted plastic edge is subject to a lot of wear and tear and eventually looks really bad. And finally, if you want to use it as a tablet, well let’s just say it is awkward because any or all of your fingers that are holding on to the back of the unit are pressing against the keyboard, which is not a good thing for obvious reasons.I can’t help but mention one particular flaw that it seems they could have done something about which is that their own preloaded update app isn’t smart enough to know when Windows is in the process of doing an update (which is pretty often). This is especially true when your unit is brand new and the first thing Windows does is brings it up to date with endless updates that can last for hours. Unfortunately Dell’s update app doesn’t respect that and barges in trying to do their own updates at the same time, the worst of which was just as Windows was finishing a major version update, they decided to flash the BIOS without asking me (which is a sensitive and major task during which absolutely nothing else should be running). This caused Windows to roll back and undo everything it took almost an hour to do. I’m lucky that the BIOS update didn’t fail and brick the entire computer. For them to permit such a conflict in software design is inexcusable.NITTY GRITTYI don’t take sides when it comes to the PC vs Mac debate. I own both plus an iPad, and I use them daily. Both can be equally adept for people who work in the graphic arts with a lot of it boiling down to personal style and work habits. With all that in mind I have certain editing specialty apps that I want to use that are PC only and I have yet to finds a PC equivalent to my iPad Pro that lets me do pen based editing on a touch screen. This computer is that bridge for me and has enough power and resolution (not the best but good enough) that I decided to load it up with all of my photo and graphic apps and dedicate it as my personal workstation.SUMMARYIts biggest downside is how much it costs, it would be a strong contender at under 500 bucks but there are too many better options above the 700 buck mark that make you wonder what they were thinking listing it so high. One impressive plus is that this model has wonderfully easy and well documented accessibility for upgrading memory, storage, battery and just about everything else, something the pretty, trendy (and expensive) models from some other brands have as a strike against them.The unit I’m I just got in early 2018 was made in late 2017 and is identified as a unit intended for Ireland and some of the user forums imply that it has already been discontinued. It’s been difficult to verify that from the manuf because it is difficult to pin down exactly what the details are for any specific model from their info.If some of this sounds like I don’t like it, that’s not the case, it may not be as cutting edge as the price would suggest but the conservative design of Dell laptops has served me well previously and I have positive vibes that this one will as well. Sure this laptop rides at the upper end of the budget considering its specs but I think you get what you pay for, and dressed in that unique Theoretical Gray color it has the look of success written all over it.	2	3	3	3	7
Great computer. I got it for work and it is so nice. Good battery life, very light and easy to take places, good quality.	2	3	3	2	8
"This review is specifically for the 14"" L402-WA-EH21.First off, a little bit of background: I am a computer person. I build, rebuild, and maintain computers both in professional and personal life.The Good Things-This computer is light weight, easy to use, feels good to type on, and starts fairly quick. Everything about this PC is built specifically to be lightweight and slim. It is specifically built to do web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, and lightweight document creation. Think of it like a Chromebook but running windows. Youtube videos run smooth, network (while n compatible, ac-based) is wifi is zippy but wired is faster, and the screen is bright and vivid (with the right settings). If you are student that needs a budget document creation tool, this will do it. If you need a computer to quickly look up information, close and toss around the living room, or send emails to grandma; this machine will do it.It also has a 2.5"" harddrive bay in a cover under the bottom of the laptop (not advertised but it's there). I have installed (and highly recommend) a 250gb ssd for the additional storage space (and if you are going to be doing any type of heavy document creation, you will need the space). It works fine without reducing battery life.At the moment, the longest I have used it was 3 hours before plugging it in, but that was because I was leaving for several hours. probably would have made 4 before having to plug it in.The Not-So-Good Things-The L402WA-EH21 has no documentation online, has no specs listed through the ASUS website, and apparently doesn't exist other than it is listed on Amazon for sale. The closest model is the E402WA on the ASUS site and comes in two different versions (i think the E is Intel based, the L is AMD based). Given that you are considering purchasing this laptop, all the documentation that you will have will come in the box; a basic start up manual, a warranty card, a small bag of screws (for the harddrive expansion bay), and a power supply.The Bad Things-I received this laptop and plugged it in and fired it up. Standard Windows set up and logged into the desktop. Always first thing to do is to check that Windows activated itself properly. It did not. Alright, so I thought there might be a problem with the OS that was installed on it, so I restored the system using the builtin restoration partition (takes about 45 minutes). I redid the Windows set up, and waited. Same information was stored in the restoration partition as was in the original install. Windows wouldn't activate.Alright, being a computer guy, I dug out the tools and scanned the keys that were installed from Asus. The version of Windows installed was 10Home, the key installed through BiOS/UEIF was a 10RTMCore, and had an origin key of 10RTMCloud. All three of these keys are for different versions, none of which are interchangeable with each-other.If you research the OS that is suppose to be installed on this computer (Windows 10S) you will find that it is identical and interchangeable with W 10Pro. Being a computer guy, I wiped the boot drive and installed Windows 10Pro from a flash drive (takes about 45 mins), did the Windows set up, had the OS pull the key from BiOS ... Windows not active...!At this point I was at a loss as what to do. I did a few activation tricks and called Microsoft Activation to see if i could manually activate Windows 10Pro. Talking to a Third Tier Tech (first two were impatient and useless, about 45 minutes being bounced around), the Tech checked the three keys that I had. The W 10H key was already registered and in use (so dead), and the W 10RTMCore and 10RTMCloud had not called home properly. YES! Two keys were available, one of them was no longer viable. Here's the nail in the coffin, I asked the Tech where I could get a ISO (the installer disk) for Windows 10 S (10RTMCloud). His exact answer ""Unfortunately, there is no way for you to get ahold of a 10S ISO image. They are distributed directly to manufacturers only."" ... Great... Just great...So... After all of that I had a brand new key, a new laptop, and no way to put the OS on it that it was suppose to be installed! Mind you, this is five hours into taking it out of the box. I finally was just about to throw it back in and ship it back when I decided to dig around in Google.So... after about an hour, I found a fix. It's complicated, it's doable if you are moderately computer savvy, and have about two hours of time; no software needed to be stolen or borrowed from illegitimate sources or anything.1. Get a Windows 10Pro image set and ready on a flashdrive and bootable.2. Install 10 Pro onto the laptop WITHOUT changing any partition information (simply delete the OS partition and stall Windows 10Pro in its place) and bypass the key entry section during install.3. Once the computer is set up and running at the desktop, check to see if the key has Activated. IF IT HAS YOU ARE FINISHED. If not, continue.4. If Windows 10Pro did not activate, you need to find the installer for W 10S. You cannot obtain an ISO, you must use an 'Upgrade' like installer. The webpage to search for is ""Test Windows 10 S on existing Windows 10 education devices"". Read most of the page so you know what you're getting into, and download the installer.5. Run the installer. It will do an 'Upgrade' install, move all of the associated profile information to a Windows.old folder on the C drive, and install Windows 10S.6. Alright, you've done this step before. Go through the Windows 10 set up.7. Once you get to the desktop, check to see if Windows 10S has been activated. At this point, Windows 10 pulled the key from the BiOS/UEIF and registered properly!8a. At this point you are ready to run. Go ahead and use the laptop as you want. You will need to run DiskCleanup as administrator to wipe out the Windows 10Pro files that are completely useless and just taking up the tiny storage.8b.If you plan on installing any software that is not Windows 10S verified (through the Windows Store) to be lightweight, this laptop HAS the ability to be upgraded to pro through the Store. Search for 'Upgrade to Pro'. It will upgrade you straight away without installing anything else. Everything that Windows 10Pro needs is already in 10S, anything that isn't will need to be downloaded and installed (which if you need them, you will know where to find them in Programs & Features through the Control Panel).Final Thoughts-Generally, I like this lightweight system. It does exactly what I need it to do; run several messengers, word processing, quick internet searches, basic presentations, and occasionally watching Twitch. If you need a small computer, this will do the trick! If you need something to run Photoshop, you will need something more powerful. If this system had of been manufactured with the proper OS on it at the getgo, it would have gotten a 4/5 Star rating... Seriously.... SIX hours of my life are gone because someone in OSImaging didn't get the memo that the BiOS/UEIF had a Windows 10S and not Windows 10Home, or 10RTMCore... If you manage to get this system with Windows 10S and not have to go through a ton of set up, or have the technical ability to do EVERYTHING I did it will be a good lightweight system. At the moment, I cannot confirm that any of the units available have the proper OS on them. I have posted the above information for anyone that might run into the same problem and really REALLY want to give the system a good shot before throwing it back in the box and sending it back."	2	1	5	0	0

I bought this laptop to use while my HP desktop is in the shop,-- it doesn't work with Verizon FIOS. This laptop works great with it! No dropping the signal, no unnecessary third-party software. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would buy it again.	3	8	6	2	9
This laptop has run wonderfully so far! I would rate it higher, except when I first received this laptop the graphics card quit working after the first week. Luckily Dell support was very helpful and replaced the whole graphics card/motherboard combo. Haven't had a problem since, and I have tested a few current video games on it just to be sure.	3	8	0	3	9

"I was skeptical, due to the fact that this computer costs less than 250. My mindset was of the idea of ""You get what you pay for.""Well, color me surprised because I am blown away by this spicy Chromebook. It gives you the real estate of a full sized computer, with the speed and reliability of a Chromebook. It does better than my Asus laptop,with every advantage on paper. The battery is a hard A+ and these units show that Chromebooks have come a long way and have applications that prevent you from having to settle.I highly recommend it."	3	0	2	0	1

I've had the Vivobook for a week. I love this machine. I have hhr combined SSD and 1 TB HD. I did my research on the specs and this is the best value I could find for the money.The machine booted up windows 10 in exactly 10 seconds! After I set up my fingerprint scan it does the fast and easy boot up every time. I am surprised by how fat it is.So far it's completely silent. No fan noise no HDD boot up noise, nada.I would suggest that you see the YouTube reviews of the machine, the keyboard is a bit plain and the build is plastic, but for me it is just fine.I love that I can upgrade it and both the memory and the SSD and this will be by far the best machine I've ever owned. I am happy with this purchase, and I think you will too.	3	8	3	3	7

"Where I can start, this has been my best laptop, the first days were a struggle, deleting the bloatware, updating drivers, downloading programs, passing file from my old laptop, the laptop was laggy sometimes, the laptop took a lot of time turning off and starting and I started to complain about my purchase, I had problems updating the Video Card, I didn't have administrator permissions, but those were little issues that I solved, then, updating all the things, drivers, setting the system for the best performance and following the instructions of others user, my laptop turned into a monster.It runs all the games that I want (Rainbow Six with all the settings full, GTA V in very high, PUBG in ultra settings,, etc) with 60+ fps and it's amazing. It doesn't overheat and now it starts really fast and it works great.I bought it for school, but I wanted something that could run some ""heavy"" games and this was more than I was expecting. This is my first ""gaming"" laptop and I'm really happy with my purchase. Now I'll get a SSD and more RAM and it will be the perfect laptop for this price.[TIP]If your graphic card appears as Intel HD Graphics use this this tip to change it to GTX's card.

"I love, love, LOVE this laptop! Been using nearly every day for a couple months now. It's honestly been the best laptop I've ever owned and I've had several ""high end"" laptops in the past that had all kinds of bugs and wonky problems that couldn't be fixed or worked around. This, laptop, though, has out-performed even my best CPU's in functionality, power, and speed! I love that the laptop is VERY quick to start up.. No waiting 10 minutes for it to boot up - more like a minute and a half. Likewise, Windows homescreen is loaded within two minutes or less of signing in... my past laptops took at least five minutes - usually more - to get everything loaded so that I could actually use it. With this laptop, I can shut it and when I open it again, it pulls out of sleep mode instantly! My past laptops would just stay frozen in a sleep state if I ever closed the laptop while it was active/in use... which really sucked considering I have three kids under five that LOVE to shut my laptop when they walk by. Everything about the laptop is fast, really. It doesn't really get hot or overheated, which was another big problem I've had with past laptops... In fact, it's never even gotten warm enough on my lap for me to want to set it on a table or elsewhere from discomfort. It is extremely quiet and I really don't hear it running unless there is a CD/DVD in and the optical drive is in motion.The ONLY thing I have noticed that may potentially be a drawback is something that might not even be the laptop's fault. On multiple occasions, I've found that after 9 or 10PM the internet would suddenly stop working. I could see all kinds of wifi networks but it would always just say ""unable to connect"" to any of them regardless of right password and other devices working just fine on the same wifi network... However, I recently went into my settings and chose to more or less 'reset to default' my network settings and since then, haven't had a single problem. So, I wouldn't even consider that a notch against, considering that resetting that one thing has worked just fine... it was probably just a very random error that, clearly, was easily able to be fixed without any sort of outside help or costly service/repair fees. =)I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is a student, does office-type work from home, or just the occasional light user. I have not tried playing video games or anything of that sort (apart from old DOS/NES games you can find to play online), so I can't really say how well it would do for a gamer."	3	8	6	2	9
Good product!	3	8	3	2	9
Bang for your buck, it's a great little basic computer. Was never a big AMD processor fan in comparison to Intel, but this A9 is decent.Have to admit my son uses it for gaming and SIMPLE animation, but for mild tasking it's been solid.	3	8	6	3	7
Battery life is the worst	4	8	2	2	3
"All things considered it is a very nice laptop. The build quality is good, the screen is good and the keyboard also. In general everything ""just works"" which is exactly what I wanted. I'm not sure if the claimed 22hours of battery life is possible under linux but it certainly does well over 14 because at one point I had it running for about that long thinking it was powered up and then discovering that the wall socket wasn't switched on.I bought this expecting to be forced to run Windows 10 on it - which wouldn't be terrible but was not what I wanted. To my pleased surprise when I tried to install Xubuntu 17.10 it installed flawlessly and the upgrade shortly afterwards to 18.04 was equally painless.I have kept w10 on it too to dual boot and w10 works fine too. The upgrade to the latest w10 version was also problem free."	2	3	3	2	5

"Not the best computer, not even close to the best. It's big. 17"" screen w/ a dvd drive and it weighs over 7 pounds. It is NOT a laptop it's more of a portable desktop. You cannot read the keys from any angle because they are the same color as the case so they blend in so well that you have to be directly over the keys to read them. And did I say it is slow. It takes 2-4 minutes to boot, and that's after I removed some of the bloat ware (skype and the anti-virus). There are no visible ready lights, so you don't know at any point of time what's going on or even if the computer is actually on. No owner's manual, not even a cd, so it's hard to get started. Some of the problems may be the operating system, Win 10. Maybe w/ Win 7 it would speed up a bit and be easier to use. As it stands now it is virtually worthless to me and I can't send it back as it was a birthday gift bought in February gifted in March, the day before the return date. Oh well, it might make an OK door stop or boat anchor. Oh yeah, it does have a beautiful screen but that's all I can say nice about this POS."	4	8	6	0	2

Not enough memory out of the box to install Windows update, now stuck with it wanting to free up disk space and update every time I start up. I haven't loaded anything on this computer and have been through uninstalling every possible app I can to get disc space, still can't update. Other than that works fine for web browsing which is what I bought it for.	2	1	2	0	0
"Bought two of these for my teenage daughters for Christmas. They LOVE them! I did purchase an extra 1TB hard drive (also from Amazon of course) for each since they only come with 128GB SSD. They boot up in 10 seconds with the solid state drive which is why I purchased them. I see no reason to pay more for a larger SSD when I can easily add a 1TB drive for $50.I do wish Dell would follow other manufacturers and add a simple compartment on the bottom for upgrading the hard drive and RAM. Instead they cover one screw with the service tag requiring you to pierce it to take the bottom off. I find that to be a horrible business practice. Hey Dell, the 90's are over and people want to upgrade their laptops themselves without paying some overpriced ""service tech"". I guess the threat is that it will void the warranty. Well not in my state.And they wonder why they're losing market share.But even with that terrible corporate Big Brother mentality, it's not worth knocking off a whole star for it."	3	2	3	3	4
"I think the star rating for this laptop is skewed a bit because the product page is for 3 different models.I bought the ""rose gold"" 4GB 11.6"" model, and so far I've been really pleased.The 4GB of RAM is crucial to getting the most from the processor. No surprise that a majority of the one star reviews on here are for the 2GB model.All hardware works perfectly, all inputs feel very snug and secure. The only port I haven't tried is the mini HDMI.The full size keyboard is a nice touch. The trackpad material is satisfyingly smooth and responsive. Gestures work great. It can lag a tiny bit if the computer gets bogged down but that happens rarely.No flapping or give on the hinge for the screen, and the surface of the plastic doesn't show fingerprints. The build quality and design of this machine is way beyond the price point.The speakers are very meh. They sound nice and clear but the bass response is absent.Now for the screen: I really want to emphasize that the factory settings for the display don't do it justice. Take the time to calibrate it and fine tune the HD graphics settings and you will be able to get a lot more contrast and vibrancy from the screen. Photos and videos looked much better after some adjustment.This laptop is extremely portable, and though it might not be Macbook Air level thin, it is actually lighter. But the light weight does not keep this from feeling like a quality computer. I did a ton of research on similar laptops with more reviews before I went for this one. I'll update this review if I experience problems in the future, but for $200 this was an excellent purchase."	2	1	5	0	0

We triggered a bomb alert in a TSA/CBP Check, due to the batteries in this laptop, it has a clock battery as well which also triggered the alert, we were detained for about an hour and the check line in the airport was closed because of the x-ray of the laptop. Until the explosive specialist came and checked it.	3	3	0	3	7
It has a nice look and started up well. I had to take it in to a tech guy to clean up though, it comes with a ton of bloatware and was hardly usable. The very first time I tried to use it, I was just paying bills. It took me about 30 minutes to pay 3 bills and I gave up. It was ridiculous. My tech friend was able to remove the bloatware by taking it back to factory settings and not allowing certain things to run on start-up. Works fine now.	3	8	6	3	7

So far i'm impressed with this laptop. I have not run a game on it yet but all web pages only take about 4 seconds to load tops. The fan for this is also dead quiet. one thing that is disappointing, my wireless mouse does not work on the very smooth surface of this laptop. My old dell was textured and it worked fine. The only surface it will work on is the built in mouse itself. Also when i'm on YouTube and I start a video it does a 5 second glitch fest when starting and ending a video. I think its just starting computer hiccups. One thing that I really like is the back-lit keyboard. Iv'e never had one and now that I do it's super cool. I do hope dell looks at this review about the wireless mouse not working. that was a bummer because now ill have to cut out a mouse pad to it's shape and if I leave it in the laptop wont close and it's gonna be really annoying to carry a round. I hope I find more amazing things about this laptop as I explore.========================================UPDATE============================================================I am becoming displeased with this laptop. I was trying to play a game called Stardew Valley (AMAZING GAME by the way) and whenever I had to shut it to do something else the screen would freeze and I would have to restart it, losing all my progress since last save. and sadly in stardew valley there isn't any save button. I'm in limbo If I should return it And get a new one or what.	3	8	0	3	9

This is a gaming laptop that cannot play games. Yes the stats are great, and the screen is beautiful, however in the 4 days ive owned this thing i cannot play a single game without a BSOD. Ive had about 25-30 so far and about 10 different varieties. I let windows do its updates, ive updated every single driver, ran memory and hard disk checks, tried everything from the forums on how to fix these and they still persist. Every game ive tried blue screens between 1 and 10 minutes in. Ive done fresh installs on the games, tried installing on both drives. tried changing the settings, running in 32 bit, and the end is still the same. After the crap I went through even getting this thing after amazon sent me a box of exhaust parts instead of the computer and then spent 3 weeks delaying my refund only to act like i did something wrong and then finally give me a refund after hinting that they still didnt believe me I had hoped my problems were finally over and i would have an awesome gaming machine...nope. I basically have a $1600 tablet because all I can do is surf the internet and check emails. I am so disappointed with this purchase. My old $500 acer with a 940mx works far better than this fancy brick.	4	8	0	5	7
This laptop ship all the way from California to Manila. I got this package last Wednesday, December 20. My first impression on this laptop -- you can spot screen bleeding near the camera. Too bad, I can't easily ship it back for replacement. I guess, I have to live with it.Overall I like the build of the laptop.	3	8	0	2	7
I am so inlove with this laptop. When I got it I felt like a kid with christmas gift. It is very light, what I am still admiring, and the size perfectly fits my smaller backpack, so I can carry it with myself whenever I need. It is really very fast, its almost have no sound ( if I want to hear, I have to stop what I am doing and try to listen) and I love the keyboard, which makes very smooth writting feeling. I really like that the screen has eye-saving mode, so it will not get tired. And the battery last for about 6-7 hours without charging. I am still enjoying to work with it.	2	3	4	2	5
Terrific laptop. An an Apple fan, I was happily surprised how easy it was to navigate this device. And it is powerful and fast.

The computer was a lemon. It was sent back and forth by Dell for weeks on end, never once resolving the issues. The warranty that comes with Amazon purchases is mail-in only, with 12 day wait times each go, and you pay out of pocket for shipping. They simply swapped the hard drive each time because it passed the cut-rate self diagnostic tool that Dell puts on your BIOS as bloatware. This machine was amazing when it ran for the first few weeks. But once it died, it got stuck ina fial to boot cycle, and I got stuck in a fail to fix cycle with Dell Support. Will never buy another Dell again. This was a terribly unreliable product, and the only thing worse is how terrible Dell support was.	3	8	0	3	9

I absolutely love my new Dell. It is my preferred brand of computer. My son accidentally spelled his drink on my last one, so he gave me a new Toshiba. It never did meet the expectations of my Dell, so I purchased this one. I have had a few problems, but it is usually operator error. I really love it. Thank you!	3	8	3	1	4
Setup took some hours, but thats Microsoft, not Acer. Runs fine. Not lightning fast but definitely an affordable upgrade from where I was. Task manager took 3 seconds to open...not sure what that other reviewer is talking about. Laptop construction feels a little cheap, but you get what you pay for. Fan is audible but not loud. Will have to remove bloatware tonight though there doesnt seem to be a lot. If youre buying this for gaming you should also look for an external graphics card cause the built in one wont handle much if you want newer games.	3	8	6	3	7

This is an incredible chromebook.The screen resolution default is not highest it can go but is about 25% - you can scale it all the way up quickly in settings / display settings but may have less battery time.Usb c ports can run generic & apple adapters for flawless hdmi output & usb peripherals. Everything I tried worked instantly even cheap generic ones.The speakers suck & I fear mine may be blown or damaged & poppy just from regular use - a real shame for a 2017 laptop as YouTube & Netflix was a likely use of this.Charges fast & keeps a charge like a champ	1	1	4	0	1
Laptop arrived working well. Only issue was the speakers quality, but i tend to use headphones anyway.I had to get a laptop cooler because the computer heated up a lot when playing games. The laptop is very sturdy and the keyboard is great! I've been playing StarCraft II on it and running Adobe Illustrator.I did have a problem with it . After a month it became slow and the games froze up. I had tried using dell support assist and it seemed to make things worse, then a after a long windows update everything on the computer was erased and the desktop wasn't functioning at all. No menus would come up and it couldn't connect online.Dell customer support wasn't helpful (the free warranty only covers hardware issues, software help cost $250) , but I did a factory reset, cleaned registries, defragged, and some other things. I basically ended up fixing the computer myself and advice from a friend. Also I removed Dell Support Assist programs (the computer was working ok until I used it. I did some research and found that support assist is known for slowing down computers. There were 4 or 5 programs that were support assist).Ended up returning it. I need something reliable.	3	8	0	2	7

Unfortunately, my lovely honeymoon with the Chromebook Plus has ended. This product is garbage. There are widespread touch screen issues that Samsung refuses to address (just look at the Samsung support forum). Yet, they just keep selling it. Samsung doesn't offer replacements — only repairs. The process can take up to FOURTEEN DAYS. For a laptop I've had for less than three months. For a laptop they should stop selling. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this one.	1	1	4	0	1
The build quality of this machine is first rate. The sound is great, the screen is great, really great. This is the standard screen that I am referring too. I know there are higher resolution options but I don’t think my eyes could detect any higher resolution. It’s gorgeous.The Bad:The NVIDIA 1070 is putting out 20 FPS out of the box. You must update the drivers.If you are not an experienced computer user you will find there are a ton of drivers to update and YOU have to sort it out.ACER tech support is no help. They suggested I check for answers elsewhere but told me I was welcome to call back.I managed but I thought ACER should have taken more of an interest in my problem.Also there are messages that pop up from Acer periodically that I believe concern the setup process but they don’t stay on the screen long enough to read them.	4	8	0	5	7

This was purchased for our daughter to be used at her school as the school required all students to have a laptop with specific capabilities.First, keys randomly fell off; all but one snapped back on. But the then the body separated in the upper left corner and literally became unhinged. This computer was not even used on a daily basis, and when not in use was in her backpack. We purchased the Asurion protection plan but I don't know if this is even repairable.	3	8	0	3	9
This is my third Acer computer and I am really a fan of the brand for the price. This is what I would describe as a simple, mid range laptop in terms of capabilities. If you plan to use it for internet browsing and light work you will really like it. It does not otherwise have a lot of memory so forget about running AutoCAD, etc as you would need something more powerful and it is non-upgradeable.Regarding the laptop itself, it is so light. It charges fast but seems to be a 7 out of 10 on battery life. Overall I am really pleased with it.	2	1	2	0	0
Although I do 90% of my technology on my phone, I do have a few things that require a PC to do. Some things are just easier to type or do on a laptop than mobile device. I had previously got a Chromebook, but there are many programs and functions that I need that were not compatible. The main hurdle I have faced lately is using my husband's laptop to use my Cricut for new downloads and projects because my Chromebook would not run it. This worked great for SVG and font files and synced flawlessly with my Cricut. From the moment I opened the box, I was pleased to find a shiny new laptop. It was actually a little bigger than I was expecting at the price point, but I was glad to see the keyboard boasted a number pad which is lacking on many laptops. Once I opened it, plugged it in and turned it on, I was greeted by a Cortana, Microsoft's version of Siri. She walked me through the set up process and I was online within minutes. The TB hard drive is a nice asset for a computer in this price point. The screen was okay but not fabulous. If you are looking for a high powered gaming computer, you may be disappointed, but I found it very appropriate for all tasks that I need it for. I would definitely recommend it for as a solid find at this price point.	3	8	3	1	3

Definitely worth the price paid for. It works exactly for what it was purchased for. My 12 year old son uses it to play his games and with the addition of the additional GB from the Flash Drive we bought with it, it serves its purpose. He is able to play his games, browse, load music and its portable. He is able to connect it to his bluetooth headphones so that is a plus. The only downside is, it does take a while to download some of the files but for the price I can't complain. Good computer for the Kiddos.	2	1	2	0	0
first off it says this has a total of 32G, the one I received only has 29.1G and 29.0G is the operating system...WTF..second I looked everywhere for the mircosoft office 365. its not on here. I cant update because there isn't enough memory. When I tried to use the store app, it says operating system is not configured to run it. I mean what the hell am I suppose to do here.

The few apps we've used have worked great, haven't had any app issues.	1	1	4	0	1
The laptop was MORE than used it was scratch all over , a key was missing from the keyboard. It looked like someone pulled it out of the trash. I was so disappointed and to make things worse it was a Christmas present. How dare you even try to sell something so defective. Appalling! I gave one start JUST because I had to !	2	0	4	0	1
I didn't expect a fancy laptop because I was looking for reliability. I had only Dell until now but they have poor reliability and many times I sent them for repair so I decided to change since my last Inspiron 17 5000 failed in 14 months. (very disappointing)First time with Asus and I'm satisfied even when I have it less than a week, I think adding memory is a must so I will. Intel Graphics worked smoothly without blinking, easy to setup unlike USB-C ports whit adapters that cause problems. No bloatware (thank you) it will upgrade Windows 10 in the initial setup, lets see about reliability in the future.Good for the price!	3	8	3	2	9

For what my mother uses this for, it is perfect for her. A million times better than that cheap crappy trash HP she used to have (that she now no longer touches). Although I am disappointed in one thing, the right touchpad key tends to stay down either when neither button is clicked for a while or the right button is clicked multiples times consecutively. It's fine once you click the left mouse button once but it can be annoying. Every light indicator is on the front side of the laptop keyboard in a row, where your left wrist is likely to cover it when typing.Edit: It appears the touchpad thing is not uncommon among laptops with that particular type of seamless, full touch touchpad. Mine does it to. Bumped this laptop up to 5 stars. Now I know for the next laptop I get that the physical touch buttons are better as they have never given me problems before. I hope they don't get phased out of gaming laptops anytime soon. This particular laptop is holding up pretty well, I would definitely say it is great for students with every day school work, studying, etc. If you use the touch pad with your right hand, be prepared to reach over a bit farther than usual, I personally don't like that the touchpad is so far to the left but it's nothing much to complain about. Unless you like to play games using WASD+Touch, in which case this is a very irritating setup. I can say nothing about the fingerprint scanner as my mother doesn't use it. Overall I'm so glad I decided to get this laptop for my mom, I almost gave her a touchscreen one from another manufacturer that actually got recalled for defects just a few months later!	3	8	3	2	9
Great laptop; slim, light, fits in my purse, and is pretty cute. It's cheaply made but I don't care about the looks.Downsides are that it doesn't offer a lot of space and that it does NOT have windows 10....which doesn't make sense. It said I needed to buy Windows 10 and activate it after 30 days of a trial.I guess $60 for buying Windows though still makes this a cheap laptop since I bought it used for $180.	2	1	5	0	0

I needed a quick replacement for my recently-dead laptop and decided on the Lenovo Ideadpad 320. This is a good budget laptop for someone who needs a cheap laptop, be it for school or work. It is pretty fast with an 8th generation i5 and 12GB of memory, but I quickly replaced the hard drive with a much fast SSD–up to 40x faster which is a recommended upgrade for whomever is tired of slow loading of windows and applications. Also, the ports are acceptable, with 2x USB type A and 1 type C, HDMI, card reader, and headphone jack, as well as a DVD drive.Now onto the less positive aspects. The battery life is mediocre, achieving a maximum of 5 hours with regular cases of 2:30 to 3 hours. That is one star deduction for me. The second deduction is from the screen. In 2018, all laptops should have a 1080p display; however, this laptop contains a 720p display, making everything appear huge. The tiny resolution packed into a large display is unacceptable, but it is what it is. The final star comes away from the keyboard, which is abhorrent. Cheap plastic and poor layout design combine to make a miserable typing experience.Ultimately, the Ideapad 320 is good for whomever wants the best laptop for his or her money, as long as they are willing to make many compromises. Just remember you get only what you pay for—nothing more and nothing less.	3	8	3	3	6
The laptop loaded right up and allowed me to create a profile no issues. After turning it off and returning to it about an hour later, I would log in and it would begin to load my profile, then just go blank for a second and return me back to the log in screen repeatedly. Returned it immediately, first and last time ever getting a refurb.	0	0	4	0	0

I'm writing this review to help those on the fence.First - many had trouble updating to the latest Windows 10 version.You have to removed all installed software, including office. Then the update will go through. Then delete the 'old Windows' file. That will clear out a lot of space.After you do this - re-download Office and the other programs you want.On to the computer - this computer is fast. A lot faster than I imagined. It multi-tasks reasonably well. I ran Word, a PDF file and Crome at the same time (with 4 tabs open on the browser) with no noticeable lag. Very nice processor.The big drawbacks other's mention - lack of storage and the weak trackpad are indeed negatives - but you have to remember this is a sub $200 computer. grab it on sale with the free 32 gig flash drive for a super value. I added an old mouse to this to get beyond the track pad weakness and the computer is running like a champ.If you have realistic expectations, this computer is a home run. If you think you can get a true gaming computer for sub $200 - you're dreaming.All in all, I give this 5 stars and recommend for anyone looking for a writing computer primarily that also can do light media and surf the internet. Get this deal.	2	1	2	0	0
Best computer I've ever had the pleasure of owning, super fast\reliable, can basically handle anything you throw at it. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something that's gonna last.	4	8	0	5	7
DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!! It runs great for a week, then everything starts breaking. My disk now runs at 100% at all times, no matter what I do. I Frequently lose all sound, then have to run system restore to get the sound back. Even plugged in, the battery slowly drains. Nothing but frustration and annoyance. I work in the PC repair field, so I do know what I am doing, as well as what I am talking about. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!	3	8	6	2	1

For $199? Are you kidding? This thing is great. I have an iPad, but needed something non-Mac to take with and run Word and actually for one client, Word Perfect. This little guy does the trick. Keep in mind, I don't have excessive expectations of it, just a little word processing is all I do with it, a little web surfing and sometimes I put a disc in my external drive and watch that, but otherwise what more could you ask for for that price. I mean honestly!	2	1	5	0	0
This was the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon.The laptop did not even come with microsoft 10....	4	8	3	1	6
I wanted a sleek clamshell laptop in aluminum for while because all the kids on campus have them, but have always used Windows, so I was excited to see this come out. I bought it for productivity (word processing, creating slides for classes, programming, photo editing and light graphics design) and it has proved a fun machine to use because of the portability and good looks. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro so I could use legacy software. The laptop has enough processing power for anything I've used it for and is nice and light. The keyboard is comfortable, the trackpad is smooth and accurate and the battery life is enough to get through most of the day with the performance and screen brightness jacked up.The screen is excellent and the build is solid. The fabric on the keyboard is holding up after four months' use and feels good.I'd be happy if they made the laptop a bit thicker put a bigger battery in it and upped the storage, but I feel that way about all my electronics. My only other minor gripe is that there is a lip at the front of the keyboard that doesn't seem to have a purpose (maybe to help opening the lid), and would be more comfortable if rounded. I had no intention of gaming on this, but as a surprise bonus, it streams my Xbox nicely.I used this successfully to expand the single USB 3.0 port to three and add Ethernet:Anker 3-Port USB-C to USB 3.0 Aluminum Portable Data Hub, with 10 Mpbs, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps, or 1 Gigabit Network Adapter with Ethernet Port, for MacBook Pro 2016, ChromeBook, XPS and More	2	3	3	2	7

Absolutely worth every penny, even the express shipping because I couldn't wait for it anymore. The keyboard feels caresses your fingers as you type on it, I've watched so many reviews about this chromebook, it's amazing to actually have one. I love it, yes it's not like the usual Microsoft computer and using Word and Onenote on the chromebook requires a little getting used to, it allows me to write down the main part of the text on my samsung and then when I'm at school I send my notes to the proper terminal.2 USB - C (Sweet Baby Jesus) I bought a SATA / USB-C adapter, then salvaged my old laptop took out the 250 gb hard-drive. Who needs a Chromebook Pro when the Chromebook plus can do so much.	1	1	4	0	1

Very disappointed with the service and product quality. I received my order and the laptop was dirty, already turned on.

Happy so far with the actual computer, but not happy with the appearance of the refirb.

I purchased my laptop about 8 months ago. It has a couple of huge issues. First, every once in a while it will stop responding to any keys. It has to be hard shut down using the pin hole on the bottom. This has happened about 3 times since purchasing the computer. The second issue is that one of the speakers makes a loud static noise when the laptop starts to get warm. It happens really fast when you do any kind of VR or play games. It is too loud to keep playing.Acer Customer Service is worse than these issues. The agents are really hard to understand and Acer will force you to ship your laptop to them, AT YOUR EXPENSE, so they can work on it.I will never buy anything from Acer ever again.	4	8	0	5	7

charged it over night. powered it on. during os update, the screen went black and would not reboot. holding in the power button for 60 seconds turned the led indicator off. pressing the power again turned the led light blue but the screen stayed black. sending it back. worst Samsung product since the note 7. buyer beware.had one from a big box store. it would update and boot but, would not run play store to install android apps.android on chrome os and the stylus were the reasons i was excited and wanted this to work but, it's not ready for prime time. I'm sad and disappointed. I don't think I'll be buying from Samsung for a very long time.	1	1	4	0	1
Acer Biom are not smooth and stable, had to update it to Insyde Software. Graphic cards and stuff runs great on ultra settings, but started lagging when playing 8-bit games. Which is weird and I don't understand. Probably it's a faulty laptop or It's just Acer. The more I use it, the more problems occur, which gets really annoying. So I have no choice, but to refund it and find a better gaming laptop brand instead.	3	3	0	3	6

Bought two of these, both had a few hours of updates out of the box, which is to be expected. Downloaded and installed Guild Wars 2 immediately (the reason I bought two of these, for me and my wife) it runs it perfectly on max settings at 70+ FPS. Fans only kicked in when I joined a heavily demanding pvp match and they were very quiet. As to be expected for a laptop it runs a little warm, but let’s be honest there’s a lot of demand on such a small package. Overall though it is a superbly fast computer that has thus far met and exceeded my expectations for a $700 laptop. Will update review after a week or so, hoping for more good reviews of it!	3	3	0	3	6

Microsoft has been really impressive recently—first the Surface Studio and now this gorgeous piece of kit. I’m a big fan of the latest tech and the Surface Laptop is a “must-have.” The fancy keyboard material is quite a nice touch and the screen is very clear. Plus it’s touch screen, which makes Apple’s touch bar look even more laughable. Recommended for anyone who is disillusioned with the other offerings. Or really anyone who wants a top of the line laptop.	2	3	3	2	8

Only 28 GB of hard drive space. I can't complete the necessary Microsoft Updates because it requires 8 GB of free space. I only have 2 GB left. This is after I installed SEP antivirus (0.99 GB), Adobe Acrobat DC (556 MB), Google Chrome (566 MB), and OpenOffice (456 MB). Even if I remove all my installs, I won't have enough to complete the operating system's critical update. I didn't need anything fancy, just something very casual....but whoever built this needs to factor in enough space for these critical updates! Ridiculous.	2	1	2	0	0

"Well, this laptop was an awesome gift for our son for the first two months we owned it. Today, hard drive failure. It's outside of the seller's warranty period, so now we're having to deal with Dell for repair. And we're seeing stories from other purchasers on various websites that the ""repaired"" laptops are having further issues down the line.It might be wise to purchase a different make and model.UPDATE: Now we can see evidence that this unit was previously serviced by Dell. We were sold a used or refurbished laptop that was represented as new."	3	8	0	2	7
I ordered my model from Best Buy, as I will start university and wanted a reliable, convenient, and dependable laptop for college years.And I love this thing, it's light, powerful, and with the large update and upgrade to Windows 10 Pro I haven't had a problem with this computer. I purchased the Surface Dock for this which truly transforms it to a desktop computer you can rely on, so this will come in handy when I come to work at home and could use the extra ports and power.The battery is great however the 14 hours part is misleading! After lightly browsing Fire Fox, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, and setting the option to best battery life, low brightness, etc. The battery only lasted about 5 hours before getting to 30%. I notice depending on what you are doing, battery performance will vary greatly, form streaming, running programs, having multiple browsers up, etc. But the battery still is great.This laptop has an excellent design, this is by far the best touch screen I've used on any computer, which will come handy if I ever need to draw quick notes in the future.CONS:-Other colors not available for the more powerful models-Screen wobbles when you touch the screen, so if that will bother you look to getting the Surface Pro-Price. It's rather common sense to not get 4 GB in 2017 if you're spending 1000+ on a laptop, so be prepared to cough up a to of cash for this. I myself spent 1500+ dollars at Best Buy with a 10% discount... I am not rich, I had to save money all summer, but it was worth it.-You won't be able to upgrade parts on this laptop or do home repairs, so MAKE SURE you get the specs that will last through four years (I assume most getting this laptop are fellow college students such as myself) and consider you may one day have to send this in for repairs. However the superior build quality makes me feel comfortable that the only way this could break is if it were my fault or I was really unlucky/careless.-No USB-C-Mini-USB, but no HDMI or USB-c...? Really Microsoft? I've always loved and used your products but come on. If you're gonna make us use all the extra dongles, at least include them!-One USB slot, NO memory card slots!Other than that, make sure to watch reviews from various trusted YouTube Channels such as from Dave Lee and Linus Tech Tips to make sure this is the Laptop you need and want!	2	3	3	2	7
Definitely received a used Surface Laptop. Box had been opened and the laptop was dirty from use. Doesn't seem to have any scratches and seems to work fine. It would be beneficial to list this as a used item or a refurbished item in the description.	2	3	3	2	8
This last 2 months biggest piece of crap!!! It sat on my desk most of the time and I needed it for a weekend trip so I unplugged it and took it with me. After unplugging it 4 or 5 times the inside adapter for the battery charging broke. When I contacted Dell they said it wasn't covered in warranty it was wear and tear.... and I would have to pay to replace it. What?!? It was two months old it should have lasted a lot longer then that. Never again I am going back to Gateway or HP both have better warranties on their products.	3	8	3	1	4
You will regret purchasing this (or most other) Asus product. Granted that nearly all electronics these days are chinese made but this manufacturer must be near the bottom as far as quality. I bought this laptop shortly before my Asus tablet died so I'm O for 2 with this manufacturer. While they are fully aware of their inadequacies their customer service alarmingly is worse than their build quality (given the low threshold this is remarkable). In both cases the motherboards failed and I suspect their strategy is too avoid repair through attrition. The customer service process is so slow and ineffective that the hours i wasted were not worth the purchase price. You might know the routine, they request documentation and redundant forms but when questioned they have no answers. Reaching a supervisor is like requesting an audience with the pope. Their competitive price was attractive bit as it turns out this laptop was a waste of money and ultimately a bigger waste of time.	2	1	5	0	0

"I work in IT so I get to see/touch and go through a lot of Windows PC's, Chromebooks and tablets.This is, by far, the best computer of any sort, Mac or otherwise, that I have ever touched, seen, owned or used. It's just perfect in every way.The hardware design is beautiful. It has a solidness to it that feels Apple or Mercedes quality. The screen is beautiful, touch, and it's fast.Battery life is great, performance is great, the keyboard has a perfect travel distance and click for those of us that are rapid typists-- you won't be disappointed.It has ""real"" usb connectivity which is so uncommon these days. The touchpad is glass and sensitive enough that I will use it. Previously Mac was the only computer with a good enough touchpad that I was willing/able to give up a wireless mouse.I could not be more pleased with this computer, I love it to the end of the world and back.

This laptop is fantastic. Light, with an aluminum shell. The keyboard has a little give, but that is pretty similar to my previous laptop and chromebook. The laptop moves quickly, the screen is bright and crisp, stays connected to the internet.

"For what you pay, I do feel that you get your money's worth. It is a fast laptop with a lot to offer. Aesthetically, I do like how it looks, but I don't like how easily it shows fingerprints.

"I run a small family business from home, and without a laptop, I'm dead in the water. My Toshiba has been slowly dying for the last few weeks, and is now on it's last leg. Great computer, but I needed another one, and fast. Boss just purchased a new laptop herself and suggested the Dell Inspiron. She said she ""loves it"".Dell Inspiron purchased, with expedited shipping. I was thrilled to receive it before 10am just two days after ordering. During setup, I noticed something I've never seen: extremely loud beeps (enough to get the entire household to ask what was going on), accompanied by error codes. All codes stated there is no hard drive. WTH???? It then popped up with a QR Code to scan, which took me to Dell's website. Yep. Dell themselves backed it up. ""No hard drive"". They were nice enough to offer to ship an external hard drive to me, free of any charges. That doesn't work on my end. Ever spend a lot of time on the road? Traveling with extra gear really bogs you down, and if they were sending me one to install myself that wouldn't be external? Yeah no.End result: Have spoken to Staples. Taking my old, kind of still working, laptop in this afternoon, buying another one, and calling the seller of the hunk of plastic that arrived today to come pick it up and give me a full refund. Also note, this is the first Dell I've ever purchased, and it will be the last."	3	9	3	3	9

Arrived quickly as promised, otherwise it's so S L O W! I just use it for email, wordprocessing, and surfing the internet. When I attempt to move the curser/mouse pointer it slides all over the place, always missing the target. I have to wait for it to stop sliding about and then redirect it to its destination, sometimes need to do it 3 or 4 times. And opening documents or web links is also extremely slow. Not really worth the one star needed to post a review. Just downloaded latest Microsoft 10 update which made a slight improvement.	3	7	5	0	0
My previous Chrome book was an HP and a little smaller, but so much faster. This one boasted being fast, but it lags quite a bit.
