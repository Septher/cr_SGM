I absolutely love this product. It is light, and ideal for traveling with. Has a SSD with more than adequate storage for my needs, more than enough RAM, more than enough CPU speed/performance for everything I do. Battery life is ~ 7h. The network connectivity chip of this PC is a welcome change from my last PC (an HP which struggled with connecting to Wifi). This laptop immediately locks in to the nearest WiFi extender in my home - or any other WiFi I connect it to. LOVE the back-lit keyboard (my MUST-HAVE feature). Just the perfect PC for me. Very happy - No hesitation recommending this product.	2	7	3	3	3
Everything about this chromebook has been working super well. It is performing better than expected, particularly the (still in beta) android app support. High notes: The screen, the app support, ease of use, and the fact that it uses the same charger as my smartphone. Low notes: track pad is a little clunky (the touch screen more than makes up for this) and the speakers are quiet. Overall none of my complaints are anything more than superficial and I would recommend this chromebook to anyone.	1	1	0	1	4

"Fantastic computer, would buy it again (just might as i don't like the ASUS C201 i bought, review available there as well). Full Microsoft license with intel chipset and SSD for $200, perfect. Be aware, this computer is used only as a ""netbook"" for myself. I don't think this computer would handle medium computing loads or multitasking."	2	0	0	1	5
The real negative is the color is not blue but a ghastly purple. Wish it had a backlit key board and the power on and off button is a pain to use.	3	5	2	9	3

"Having waited for this since 2016, the Samsung Chromebook Plus has comfortably lived up to astronomical expectations - replacing both my ipad and laptop and doing a better job of both. I am new to Chrome OS but I can tell you now it's going to take something special to pull me away.Pros:- Browsing is quick and light- it takes about 6 seconds to switch on and 3 seconds to log in. While this is much more than a Chromebook, it certainly isn't less than a Chromebook. (I'm also a sucker for Chrome OS keyboard shortcuts.)- Android apps: I love how well it syncs with my phone - whatsapp, wunderlist, google books, google docs, spotify, youtube.. can all be put down on one and picked up on the other without going through finnicky browser copies.- Screen: i) Aspect Ratio ii) Definition iii) Touchscreen. i) 3 x 2 is preferred for browsing - makes much more sense for web pages and far better for tablet experience - read ebooks and edit pages comfortably in portrait mode. And I don't feel it when I watch videos. ii) Screen is super crisp and really nice for watching videos and viewing pictures on. Need to see it to understand. iii) Touchscreen/trackpad combo is a winner - only one is a bit frustrating sometimes, having the functionality of both is ideal.- Battery life: Kills it. 10 hours if you try, 8 if you don't. Charges in about 2 hours.- Super light and thin (I can't even tell if it's in my bag or not), comfortably light enough to hold, and very very thin- thinner than my ipad and case!- Convertible: As well as the obvious bonuses of this, I feel not enough has been said about tucking the keys under the screen with the screen at 45 degrees and the keys like a stand on your lap- really nice for skype, videos, and really comfortable to scroll through pages. The other good thing is it can do every angle so you don't have to adjust your seating based on how the stand as I used to with an iPad, you can just tilt the screen differently and not have to hold it at the angle you want. This is also ideal when combined with how thin it is - because the screen by itself is thinner than any tablet.- No viruses at all- Stylus works really well with palm rejection, looking forward to Google Keep being improved as we go.Things other people have complained about I haven't found to be issues:- Speakers: crackling once or twice in 2 months but quickly fixed but turning the volume town or moving the laptop, nothing worse than having it near a magnet or something- Android apps: Only one I use that doesn't size properly. A bit of screen flashing once or twice, but nothing more than rebooting the app needed. Expecting this to be all good when the pro comes out in April- Processor speed: never felt slow bothered me, can't see why you'd need a pro, just close tabs / apps you're not using - easy to do when you can reopen them so quickly.- No backlit keyboard: People, it's 2017, how are you still looking at the keys? Also, are you also 15 trying to stay up without your parents knowing? The brightness from the screen is plenty for any setting I'd say, even if you can't touch-type.Who should buy this?Anyone who wants something for entertainment and personal use that's well built, portable and fast. This is the mother of all notebooks, as light as a feather without a bloated or tablet operating system, perfect for anything you'd do at home or in a coffee shop.This also works very well as a 3rd device or a laptop for kids/teenagers (especially with the stylus).Who shouldn't buy this?- Video editors - probably need a more developed operating system- People who need some special apple/microsoft only programme (eg iMessage, Garage Band or people who can only code in VBA)P.S. Good tip: I've really benefited from having a phone I can turn into a wi-fi router and a good amount of 4G internet on my contract. Worth getting if you want to use this on the go a lot.PPS Ordered to the UK and works well - just need to get a plug adaptor and get used to "",@, £,# switching around."	1	1	0	1	4

How can Amazon advertise such poor quality item as Prime? Folks, take a look at all the reviews. The Chromebook case is badly worn and has a dirty appearance but unfortunately you can't wash off the dirt as its rubbed in so deeply. Mine was also missing rubber feet.

I bought this laptop at the beginning of my college semester and i've had it for about 7 months now. It was working really well at first, but after a few months, it started to freeze up more often. Whenever it does, my mouse wouldn't move, any keys i press don't make a difference, and it also produces this strange sound. I would have to restart it every time but its happening more frequently now. As I am a colle student, its essential to have a laptop to use so I'm beginning to think of ditching it and getting a new one from a different brand.	2	5	2	3	4

I had been looking for an affordable laptop with the features this laptop has. There were no reviews at the time, but I was pleased with the specs and ordered it. This is a decent laptop for the money. This is not a very powerful laptop, but for my basic needs it will work well. I have found when using the laptop when it's charging, it gets hot around the upper left area of the keyboard. There are a lot of programs on here that you will probably want to remove as there is about 10 GB of free space remaining when it arrives. The laptop is light being under 4 lbs and nice and thin to take on the go. Overall a decent value and buy for the money.	2	0	0	1	2

This computer has been listed in both the bulleted product description and in an image as having an 'all day' 38 WHr battery, which is certainly true of the previous version that I also own. The one that is currently shipping and that I just received, however, came with an 18.75 WHr batter that is already showing 7% battery wear before any use and that is going to provide no more than 7-8 hrs of battery life brand new (dropping thereafter as usual). Clearly as part of cost cutting Asus downgraded this system. MAJOR FAIL. Back it goes....	2	0	0	1	5
I bought it when it was on sale for about $897 so that made it even more worth it. Laptop fans get pretty loud during gaming so headphones are an absolute must. I've only played a few games so far (PUBG, Overwatch, Civ 6) but they've all been able to run at high-ultra with no problems. Fan noise is mostly non-existent during normal use (web browsing, creating office documents, etc). Laptop fans keep the system pretty at a good core temp during gaming. Overall fantastic laptop.	3	7	2	8	0

I've been working on computers for half my life and this one flummoxes me. The primary C drive is only 28GB - not enough to install Windows 10 and run things like, oh, say, a swap file, which makes performance AWFUL. You can add an SD card, but the SD slot is very poor build quality. Half the card pokes out of the shell, meaning it WILL get bent out of shape. The driver that runs the Intel TPM always launches and consumes > 50% of the CPU, and during the process it prevents a lot of devices, including the touchpad, from working. Meanwhile because of your busted SD card your D drive is going ON off ON off ON off ON off.It's just badly built. Given the price I was ready to make some concessions, but this thing is barely functional. Not to mention it comes with Windows 10 1703, and doesn't have enough room on the drive to download 1709.Awful, awful computer. Skip it.	2	0	0	1	2

We have several tablets in our family, but this is actually the first laptop we have used in a few years. The Microsoft Surface Laptop combines some of the best features of a tablet, such as touch screen capability, thin and lightweight portability, and features like facial recognition software, with some of the dedicated laptop features that I have been wanting for a while, such as a permanent keyboard and touch pad. At less than three pounds, this really is a remarkable unit that boasts the power of a PC with the footprint of an iPad Pro.There are a few features here that I especially appreciate, such as the surprisingly soft textured keyboard cover that I was not at all expecting. Not only does the speckled gray color blend nicely with the laptop exterior, but it's easy on my wrist and fingers when typing or scrolling along the touch pad. Beyond the keyboard, which is much sturdier than the portable Bluetooth keyboards that I have used with my iPad over the years (that consistently fall apart after a few months), this responsive touchscreen works just as well as my iPad Air 2. It's very easy to shift from keyboard to touch pad to touchscreen depending upon what I am working on or trying to accomplish.Although I have not used many laptops in recent years, I found this unit to be very reliable and on point based on my knowledge of what is available in the market. The 8GG RAM makes this unit quite fast and responsive--in fact one of the best I have encountered on a PC. As with most modern laptops, the hard drive is solid state which allows for greater ease and reliability when travelling. The drive has 256GB which holds plenty of video, music, and document files. I use this to supplement my larger desktop computer at home, but it is perfectly functional and has the capacity to serve as someone's primary or only PC on a regular day-to-day basis.I am in a unique position in terms of brand loyalty because I have almost excessively been a Microsoft user in terms of computers while at the time only really using Apple mobile devices. There is definitely a convergence of styles here with this laptop. In fact, just looking at the white box with its minimalist, streamlined design, I could have sworn I was opening an iPad Pro or something similar from Apple. Even the charger is somewhat reminiscent of an Apple unit (although in black). If you are traditionally a MacBook user, I think you will find plenty to like with this Surface Laptop. All in all, I was very impressed and will make good use of this at home, in the office, and on the go.	2	8	2	3	3
Since I have had this laptop I have spent hours on the phone with Microsoft and HP as well as all the software vendors I tried to download to this machine like Microsoft 365, Mcafee. had a computer guy come to my house to help me. I was not familiar with windows 10 asked Microsoft for help they made me purchase a subscription for $59 down and $15.99 a month. Once I learned Microsoft 365 could help me with their products for free I cancelled the other subscription but they wouldn’t refund my $59 because they said they did work on my computer what they did was not what I asked for and never gave me any insight into Windows 10. The Laptop came with no setup instructions or user manual when you call you have to go to support.microsoft.com to read through pages of documentation to tell you how to half do anything. I received this computer on 12/10/2017 on 12/11/2017 I fell and spent the next six weeks I The Hospital and home recovery. When I finally got the computer out of the box it was late to return so now I’m stuck paying someone to get it to work right.	4	6	4	8	3

Great specs but the fingerprints because of the material used make it look disgusting, especially at night where all the fingerprints are even more visible.

In 2007 I built my own gaming desktop, when I moved to college I spent $1800 on an Alienware gaming laptop which carried me from 2012-2017. Just bought this November of 17, and am extremely pleased. Lightweight, powerful enough to run all my steam games and MOBAs, with a great look and feel. All of this comes together in the most inexpensive computer I've ever owned.The only possible complaint I have is that the speakers do not get very loud, but the $30 I spent on an external speaker still puts the total cost of this hundreds of dollars below anything else I've owned.	3	7	2	8	0

I have noticed how slow the laptop may seem to be, but consider windows 10 is a big OS compared to the earlier versions. Also Hard Drives is slower than Solid State Drives. But is this bad? Not necessarily. You have enough power to game and do light video editing. This is not a workstation gaming laptop costing over $2,000. Tech guys has always been iffy on AMD APUs but after I figure out how to keep software up-to-date, it works wonderful. For me I love this purchase and it works for me. Eventually I might add in an ssd and expand to 16 gb of ram but this is enough for me.So my final verdict is for someone on a budget, this is perfect for light gaming and video editing. For better than this, either spend more for upgrades of this laptop, or go for something dedicated to 24/7 heavy use. Thank you Lenovo and AMD. I am impressed for what I got.Update November 29, 2017: My laptop froze and I know why. Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge was acting wonky. So a heads up. Download current AMD software and CCleaner or a better Cleaner. After CCleaner removes temp files from Microsoft Edge, one day of browsing internet and 1 gigabyte of hard drive space was Microsoft Edge ONLY. So lesson learned, always clean your PC the moment it gets slow. Looking at it, Microsoft Edge and Windows 10 is POWER HUNGRY. I hope Windows 10 improves better in the near future.	3	2	1	8	7
Little slower than I would have expected, but once you take the bloatware off the speed picks up considerably. The set up took 2 hours which is obnoxiously long and tell you the truth quite annoying. I usually buy ASUS products and will probably go back there for my next purchase. It is also feels cheaply made.It is ok, nothing special..	3	9	3	9	3
"I know we all don't like to read negative reviews because we want this product to be the ""one"" after hours of comparing and contrasting but based on our experience with this laptop, I must give it a ONE star. Usually I don't write reviews but this is extremely disappointing because I always saw Lenovo as a budget friendly quality product. We bought this laptop for simple tasks such as browsing for products on the web and create basic excel sheets. It did not happen without any frustration. It took forever for the laptop to operate. We were actually deciding between this Lenovo and the Acer Aspire but decided on this one due to the 8GB of RAM. It was a bad decision purchasing this laptop because the computer would freeze as if it was a 5 year old laptop. Websites took MINUTES to load completely and the same goes for opening any application.I do use a Lenovo tower at home and it is magnificent, I wish I can say the same about this Laptop."	3	2	1	8	7
I was going to give one star, but it does work. It looks like it was pulled out of a dumpster. Discolored (some kind of pink stuff) and the edges looked burned.

the product is what I expected, with a couple flaws. I had an issue with the graphics, on an online game. I sent it in to be checked. It seemed like a pretty simple issue to me, replace the graphics card. It took 6 weeks for the manufacturer to look at it and get it back to MSI (I thought they were the manufacturer?). They replaced the graphics card. It was fine at first, but the problem is creeping back again...idk if i should send it back in again! In general I like the notebook, it is exactly what it says it is. BUT. The support isn't all that great.	3	8	3	8	0

"It doesn't look like much closed, and it has a very lightweight, plastic feel which makes me question how durable it might be if carried around and moved a lot. The lightweight construction does make it comfortable and easy to carry. It is a nice, big, full-size laptop that seems like a great model to send off to college with a responsible student. There is nothing obviously ""gamer"" looking about the unit until it is opened, and then the blue light of the neon blue keyboard looks ultra cool.The keyboard is shallow but easy to get used to, and the mousepad is not so large that it is hard to do simple things with. (I have found some gaming keyboards have touchpads so large that it is hard to copy and paste quickly, for example.)The display looks nice when watching movies in high def, and the performance when streaming high definition movies is awesome. It has plenty of power for doing graphics and video editing. Gameplay for me is smooth and even, though I typically only play roleplaying and puzzle games at full screen. The audio is a decent volume to hear if watching movies or videos, but headphones or bt speaker are needed for any decent volume to share or for an immersive experience.It does come ready for wireless network connection, but it has a wired port for LAN parties, or possibly for travel needs.It does have hdmi2, and it has a C port, so I am thinking that I might collect a video capture card to it and use it for streaming on Twitch. I love that it is quick to charge, and that fully charged, it is lasting me over 6 hours."	3	7	3	3	0

The new 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touchscreen Laptop represents the next phase in the evolution of computing devices based on the Chrome Operating System. This Samsung Chromebook Plus is definitely a five-star computer for any individual who would regularly use both its laptop and tablet modes, who would benefit from the more vertically-oriented and webpage-accommodating 3:2 aspect ratio of its display, who would regularly use its built-in pen as an adjunctive input device, and who would regularly utilize its out-of-the-box accessibility of Android Applications. However, it should be noted, that some reviewers have deducted one or more stars for its somewhat cramped and non-tactile keyboard, its lack of keyboard backlighting at this mid-level price point, its less than rich and robust speakers, and the inevitable glitches in the functionality of the newly-integrated Android Applications in a Chrome OS device. But, to be fair, these areas of concern are highly subjective, and they do not actually detract from the overall computing experience of most users. Other than the exciting prospect of having Android Applications readily available as soon as the Samsung Chromebook Plus is set up, its absolutely bright (400-nits), crisp (234 pixels-per-inch), and beautiful touch-enabled 2400x1600p Quad-HD IPS display, is widely considered to be its premier feature. In fact, the 400-nit display of the Samsung Chromebook Plus is so bright, and it lights up the keyboard so effectively, that the quality of the computing experience is not appreciably lessened by the lack of keyboard backlighting. Of course, for most Chromebook users, the quality of the overall computing experience is largely determined by the power and performance of the processor. This 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus unit is powered by the ARM-based 2.0GHz Hexa-Core OP1 processor, with the big.LITTLE configuration, consisting of Dual Cortex-A72 Cores, along with Quad Cortex-A53 Cores. The smaller, less powerful, and less power-consuming Cortex-A53 Cores handle routine computing tasks, whereas the larger, more powerful, and more power-consuming Cortex-A72 Cores are only activated by the operating system when they are required for a more demanding workload. This big.LITTLE power optimization technology facilitates excellent energy efficiency, which results in lengthy battery life and run time. The ARM-based 2.0GHz Hexa-Core OP1 processor, which powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus, provides sufficient capability and performance for mainstream day-to-day productivity and entertainment activities, and can support all but the most extreme levels of multitasking, without noticeable lagging or hesitation. In addition, it renders webpages rapidly, and it provides for smooth scrolling and navigation on content-rich and graphics-heavy websites. For those users who require more capability and performance, it would be prudent to wait for the availability of the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which is almost identical to the Samsung Chromebook Plus, except for the fact that it is equipped with a more powerful Intel Core m3-6Y30 mobile processor. Regarding the other essential characteristics and components of this 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus device, it features an understated and elegant platinum silver design, ultra-thin (0.55-inch) and ultra-light (2.4 pounds) aluminum unibody construction, 4GB of system memory, 32GB of eMMC flash storage, two USB-C connectivity ports, one conveniently situated on either side of the device, each with a 5Gbps data transfer rate, a micro-SD card slot, a combined audio jack, 802.11a/c WiFi capability, 2x2 wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.0, and 4K display out. The battery life of the Samsung Chromebook Plus is approximately eight hours for combined productivity and entertainment activities, which is impressive, considering the increased power requirements of its exceedingly high-resolution display. For users who absolutely must have a backlit keyboard, and who would have little need for Android Applications or a built-in pen, there are other more suitable mid-level Chromebooks that are currently available. However, this new Samsung Chromebook Plus model would be ideal for any Chromebook user for whom a bright, vibrant, and high-resolution display is a priority, for whom its mobile ARM-based processor would provide sufficient power and performance, who regularly utilizes Android Applications, who would regularly utilize its built-in pen for note-taking, drawing, and other forms of input, and whose workflow would not be compromised by its somewhat non-tactile and non-backlit keyboard. In conclusion, this new 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus Touchscreen Laptop is an outstanding convertible computer, and it has enough superb features and components to merit a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.	1	1	0	1	4

When I first received this PC it was amazing it was the best bang for you buck PC I could find. It ran all my games max settings and around 60fps. Mind you I treat this PC like a God and have a nice cooling stand and it never moves from my desk. All I do is game and leave my Desktop to my regular computer needs. Ive had this PC for 3 months now and I cant play any demanding games without the CPU maxing out to 100% and causing major shuddering. This did not happen at first but now games like GTA5 have a 60% GPU usage and 100% CPU. Usually the bottleneck is the GPU but for some reason its the CPU on this PC. I have the task manger out any there is no other application hoggign the CPU its just the games causing this to happen.TLDR; CPU major bottleneck always 100% usage	3	7	2	8	0

"It might a bit too early to write a review, but I've had this for a few solid days now and overall impression is excellent.For $200, you have to forgive its shortcomings and set your expectations realistically-- but it is still impressive what you can do with a laptop computer that costs less than your average tablet. Even at $300 or $400, I'd say this is still a good buy.Like a lot of people, I have multiple computers that each serve a niche. I have: Apple MacBook Air 13"" Early-2014 (i5 with 256GB SSD), iPad 2 32GB, Samsung Note 4, Note 5, Note 3, Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, Galaxy S5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S, etc. [I buy and sell used and fix phones, so I have a lot of phones: main phone now is the Note 4...], and an old home-built AMD Windows 7 Desktop (used to be gaming machine with 2 video cards).My #1 rule with laptops is that it has to be light and portable, otherwise why bother. In real estate, it's ""location, location, location"". In laptops, it's ""weight, weight, weight"". This is why my MacBook Air is my main computer. I carry that thing everywhere and battery life is great. But alas! I have a need for a Windows computer, and my old home-brewed desktop is aging (almost 10 years old now) and I figure a lightweight laptop would be nice. Since it's not my main computer, I can forgo a lot of features and storage space, so I was looking for something compact and light. I used to have a ""netbook"" from Samsung about 5 years ago which was very small with cramped keyboard and very very slow, and I wasn't impressed. So I bought this E200HA with some hesitation that it might be the same type of ""netbook"". For $200, what the hell, I said...I mainly need a Windows machine because I currently run a few Windows-only programs on my Mac via emulation and as anyone knows, emulation is very laggy and slow. So the 2 things my Windows laptop needs to run are: 1. Quickbooks, which I use for my small business accounting [their Mac version doesn't have features that their Windows version has, which I need (inventory-related features)], and 2. Proprietary BMW software for reading error codes and programming the car (INPA, EDIBAS, NC Expert, etc.). Mind you, I've been running these on my Mac for a few years now, but at painfully slow speeds. The Asus E200HA handles these software well, so it serves it purpose and therefore I am happy.But beyond that, it impressed me with its long battery life (I got about 11 hours at 80% screen brightness and moderate use), multi-task ability (4GB of RAM)-- I have 10 tabs open in Google Chrome and no lag. I don't know what some of the other reviewers saying you can't have more than 2 tabs open... YouTube videos stream fine. I have an average of about 3-4 programs open in addition to my Chrome browser and it works fine, no lag, no crashes.The computer's internal drive is 32GB SSD (solid-state drive-- no moving parts), which after the default Windows 10 64-Bit Home Edition install leaves about 17GB of free space for storage. I put in a 64GB MicroSD card in the slot for extra storage, but haven't used it yet. I'm down to 8GB free on my main SSD. A 128GB SD card also works, FYI, even though officially Asus says 64GB max. The faster USB 3 port is to the left and the slower USB 2 port is to the right. They work as intended. I hooked up my external Seagate Slim 2TB drive to the USB 3.0 port and transfers are fast as expected. The power supply looks a bit like a USB or Thunderbolt, but it's not-- it's a proprietary plug. The charger itself is very light, like a cell phone charger. External video is possible via a mini HDMI port (you need a mini-HDMI to standard-HDMI cable or adapter-- the cable is like $7 from AmazonBasics, not too bad). The trackpad is large like on a Macbook, and has gesture, but not as elegant or good as the one on my Mac, but still good for 2-finger scrolling and touch tapping. The keyboard is a bit plasticy and light and a bit smaller scale than a full-size keyboard, but not too shabby. Screen isn't anything impressive, but it gets quite bright at 100% brightness. ASUS has a guarantee on dead pixels, so that's good to know.All in all, for $200 this is quite a bargain and a great little computer. The 32GB internal storage was a concern for me, but if this isn't your main computer, it's nothing to worry about. If it is, you need to budget ~$40 for a 128GB SD Card or ~$80 for an external USB 3.0 2TB drive."	2	0	0	1	5
This is a nice computer. The processor is fairly fact and the set up was very easy. The only issue with the laptop is that the battery life could be better. Using it for normal browsing you get approximately 4 hours this is below the 5 hours average as stated by the Website.	3	2	1	8	7

"Love this laptop. I'm so sad to see the newer gen laptops that have removed the MicroSD card reader and all the ""normal"" USB ports. This laptop has been rock solid. I'm running Linux Mint on it and it works perfectly. The keyboard is perfect - especially the arrow keys (the newer models cram the four arrow keys together in a very un-user-friendly way, but this model has a great keyboard.) The matte screen is exactly what I wanted. I absolutely didn't want a touch screen, they waste battery and you end up with a screen covered in fingerprints and one that reflects everything behind you, making it difficult to get work done.All in all, this was a great purchase. Thank you Asus for providing a great laptop for Linux users!"	2	6	5	4	3

I actully loved it until it decided to not turn on one day. I had to put in a SD card in order to do windows updates, even before loading any other software. Moving things onto the SD card to free up space seemed to make the computer run better. It would occasionally run a little slow when I had multiple PDFs and web browsers open; in general it ran fine for day to day tasks. I would like to buy another one to see if it was just a fluke that it wouldn't turn on, but they are too popular!Amazon was great and let me return in 1 month after purchase since it died.	2	0	0	1	5

Within the first few days of getting used to my laptop the monitor died and I had to send it back to ASUS. ASUS customer support was through CHAT and cumbersome. After a week, they sent my computer back to the wrong address and it was ridiculously complicated to finally get the laptop back.It has worked well except for an initial hiccup on turning it on. Now a few weeks later monitor has died AGAIN.Not worth it. I will return it.	3	7	3	8	3

It does the job for the price! Main uses: schoolHighlights:1. Long battery life (coming from a gaming laptop)2. Charging does not take too long (I don't keep track but it doesn't feel long)3. Light and portable4. I think the video memory is good enoughFaults:1. Only 32gb of EMMIC (something like that). I did buy a 128gb micro sd card, but there are limitations. I cannot update my computer due to a lack of memory so keep that in mind.2. If you have too many programs and windows opened it will lag! What I mean by too many is windows word (with 2 files opened), google browser with 5 + tabs, and another windows open, trying to look for another file.overall, it is great for what it is. Adequate enough for school uses.	2	0	0	1	5

"Who sells a computer, calls it Windows but when it comes it's Windows 10S, the ""Free"" upgrade to Windows Pro doesn't work, there's no Windows certification sticker anywhere and it demands a Product code you don't supply. Of course in the anti-competetive ways of Microsoft you can't install Chrome, Firefox or Java because they are ""unverfied Apps"". What a bunch of crap this computer might as well be a boat anchor with me stuck with the virus called Microsoft Edge and absolutely no paperwork with a Product code which the last time I checked meant it's not a legal version of Windows. Try to say in your add that new users will have a nightmare of trying to make this a workable computer, what a waste of my time."	2	0	0	1	5

As the keyboard, ease of updating, and computer speed are very important characteristics for a computer, I opted to reset the HP to factory condition and returned it, and ordered the Dell Inspiron 1550 instead.I needed to replace two ASUS laptops that were manufactured back when they had a well-earned reputation for keyboard and display 'issues.' My partner wanted the Dell Inspiron 1550, and I thought I'd try this HP being half a pound lighter and except for the fingerprint scanner on the Dell, had the same processing power. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like the more lightweight laptop, it was simply junk compared with the Dell which was only about $20 more expensive. The display on the HP was grainy, the Dell HD. The HP has a mic, the Dell has stereo mics. Dell has a great fingerprint scanning option, the HP did not. The keyboard on the Dell had easy to read and well-spaced keys, with or without the backlight. The HP's keys were difficult to distinguish from one another, with the light from underneath being brighter than the keys, and very narrow spacing between them.Last, the breaking point that had me stop setting up the HP, was that with each required update, the Dell was consistently twice as fast and each update was easily accomplished. Several updates on The HP, for some reason, kept completely failing, requiring extra hours for the update.	3	6	2	8	3
Love this little thing, it's pretty and even looks like an expensive Mac. The system is pretty basic but runs well. Need some serious external micro SD storage because the operating system takes up most of the hardrive. You can't upgrade or update the internal built in hardrive. It's a great computer for quick easy documents, mild office work. It's awesome for web browsing. Hate windows 10 and refuse to use horrible Microsoft edge. Overall great little machine. Battery life is amazing. NOT good for gaming, heavy use, photo storage, or music storage.	2	0	0	1	5
Runs Android apps great, best portable gaming platform I've used. For smaller productivity tasks, Docs works great. I was under the impression that Android versions of MS Office were available under the Officer 365 subscription, however this is not currently the case. Either way, not the fault of the device. The screen is very bright easy to read, and the 4:3 ratio actually works very well on a device this size.My only criticism is that working with larger .docx files (around 2.5mb) does tend to be a bit laggy, whether you use Word Online or Docs. Shutting down Chrome and using the just Android version of Docs worked a bit better. Don't ask this system to do too much at once.Dollar for dollar, this was a better buy than any of the Windows 10 laptops I could have bought in Australia, since the Chrome OS is so resource-light. My main criteria were high portability and enough battery life to get me through a 5-6 hour tabletop gaming session, and the Chromebook ticks both of those boxes nicely.Note for anyone considering this device outside of the US and Canada: the charger is rated for 110v - 240v, so as long as your mains supply falls within that range you should only need a socket adaptor. You should seek local advice before plugging it in though.	1	1	0	1	4

Where to start, this laptop had so much problems it gave me a frigging headache. First the Windows update 1709 issue and so many other updates messed up the laptop and I couldn't do anything on it. Second the NVIDIA drivers or the hard drive it came with was damaged or something on arrival so I couldn't play anything or do anything. Third, Windows and Dell support couldn't do anything helpful, and this laptop wasn't as fast as advertised from the webpage. Thanks Dell and Amazon for a crappy laptop for over 500 dollars!	3	7	3	8	0
So, first thing is first: I am not a heavy PC gamer. I play mostly consoles when I do game. But I needed a new laptop for school and music production and it's rare to find a laptop with an actual graphics card higher than a 960M for this price.A few points:This DID come with 8GB DDR4 RAM, a 4GB GTX 1050 (not the Ti edition), and a 1TB hard drive. It does support up to 32GB RAM using 2 16GB sticks, and is upgradeable through a door on the bottom.Pros:-This laptop feels sturdy and solid. I love the red accents and the solid black main body color.-The graphics card has handled the light gaming I've done with it with flying colors. So far, I've tested Portal 2 at maxed out settings and it's done roughly 180-200fps. LA Noire at all maxed settings keeps a steady 30fps (it's frame locked), Metro 2033 at maxed settings runs at roughly 45fps.-The Intel i5 has been a solid CPU for it as well.-The wifi uses ac and b/g/n so it makes full usage of the 5ghz channel for wireless. The speed difference is night and day. I get almost triple the download speed using ac over b/g/n.-Battery life unplugged and surfing the internet is really good. 7-8 hours.Cons:-Ok, so this is my major issue and the only reason it's not getting 5 stars. The speakers are...not great. They advertise a subwoofer, but I'm not sure what the deal with that is since the bass on this is average at best. The speakers do tend to crackle and distort at higher volumes to the point where a musician like myself gets very annoyed. I'm actually debating on buying a bluetooth speaker to use instead.Overall, if you're looking for a solid gaming laptop, this is probably the best one I've found, but be aware that the speakers are not great and I almost feel like they dropped sound quality to increase graphics quality. It's a weird trade.	3	7	3	8	0
So far...so good! I just wish I had gotten a smaller screen. Apparently, the larger screens come with a keyboard with the numeric keypad which I really did not want. I'm always putting my hands on the keyboard in the wrong spot because of the numeric keypad, but that's my problem. For those of you who like the numeric keypad, the keyboard is really good. The keys are very responsive. The screen is beautiful and the computer, too! The touchscreen is not something I'm used to using so have not really tested it...so no comment on that! Overall, it is a really good computer!	3	4	2	8	3
I bought this laptop for gaming and working. It fulfils my requirements: runs PUBG at 1080P High settings at mid-50s FPS.I do not identify any thermal issues with my device. I am surprised at how good the speakers sound. The screen is acceptable, not great. Built quality is decent.	3	6	3	3	0
Computer functions exactly as it should. For the price range, the 5+ hour battery life exceeded expectations. It came with a free upgrade to Windows 10. Note that after upgrade and installing BASIC software (office and not much else), one should not expect more than 5GB to spare on the HDD. I use a 128GB SD card for storage. Slow, but that is the fault of the full HDD and not the specs, which are very decent for $200.All in all, I recomend for office work only, but it is eccellent for those on an extreme budget.	2	0	0	1	5

I'd buy a used MacBook Pro for about the same price instead of this again. It's....so...slow.... and can't even really run iTunes without running out of space. Keep in mind you can't store everything on an external USB slot you put in. I have a 2010 MCB and it runs so much faster and has way more storage than this thing that now just collects dust in my closet.	2	0	0	1	5
I am going to preface this with the statement that I am not a tech nerd or even remotely tech knowledgeable. I can only really comment on the laptop as I see it and how it performs for me. Please feel free to look at other reviewers if you want more technical information. The outward appearance is absolutely stunning. The casing has a solid sturdy feel that is a major improvement from the plastic cased laptops I've had over the years. It is very sleek and the lack of screws and venting make for smooth, uninterrupted lines. There is fabric on the deck and I have to say that it's one of the best highlights of the machine. Normally I end up with sweaty or sticky palms/wrists when typing for an extended period of time, but not anymore. The laptop also generates far less heat than any I have ever used before. I don't have to put it on top of a pillow when I'm sitting on the couch and it seems to stay pretty cool to the touch. The keypad and track pad are total stunners on this machine. Both seem almost perfect in their response and tactile feeling. I like the back-lighting adjustment feature for the keypad so that I can conserve battery power when using it at night. I am also impressed with the speakers and how they are located under the keyboard, keeping the deck looking sleek and slimmed down. They do put out very good sound for laptop speakers too. I have noticed people complaining about the lack of USB-C ports.......I don't really know what that is. This machine has enough for what I need to use, and I am assuming for general day to day use it will suit people just fine. The speed and performance are also on the higher end of what I am used to for general computing/word processing and other type of functions. I have a TV and a tablet already, so I am not using this for gaming or movie watching. I think that for most people who want a computer for general day to day use, this will be perfect fit. The last bit is about the OS. I have to agree with other reviewers on this portion.....it's not very useful at all. It is really the only negative thing I have to say about this laptop, and it's easily remedied anyway. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade to something that's high end, without dealing with too high of a price or more machine than you actually need, this Surface has it all. I feel like I get the aesthetics of a Mac with the familiarity and ease of use in a PC.	2	8	2	3	3

This is my first Chromebook and I love it. I'd been looking at them for a long time, but really wanted a little more functionality than they contained. Once they got Android apps, that clinched it for me. Once I started looking, this was the clear winner because of the build quality and beautiful screen. I really wanted to avoid the typical plastic-y and cheap feeling Chromebook and this does a great job of avoiding that.Of course, this is a Chromebook and I wouldn't be able to use it as my only device, but it makes a great addition to my desktop. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a laptop replacement if it was my only computing device. Also, the keyboard is decent but it's definitely more of a tablet replacement than laptop replacement because there's no way I'd want to type more than a few paragraphs at a time on it.	1	1	0	1	4

"Why I bought this laptop:I needed to replace a very long in the tooth Dell that sits on my desk and is used intermittently during the day and taken home on the weekends. I don't need a real powerhouse and just need something to do some diagnostics and remote into my desktop from home if needed. I have a few of the Zenbooks deployed and they seem to be quality machines so I am comfortable with ASUS laptops.I knew that I wouldn't be using Windows so the fact this has Windows Home was not an issue. If I were keeping Windows, I would have went with one that had PRO on it already or upgraded to Enterprise. I took the 5400 RPM drive that Windows was installed on and replaced it with an SSD drive. This laptop has easy access to the hard drive and RAM.I installed Ubuntu Gnome 17.04. The peripherals I use (wireless, LAN, display, trackpad, audio) all work. I didn't try to get the fingerprint reader working.Pros:Powerful for price - I5, 8GB RAM, FHDEasy access to replace hard drive and RAMUbuntu works out of box12 month warranty. Pretty standard on electronics. 30 day replacement with Amazon. I haven't required any use of the warranty.Cons:If I were going to be closing and opening the lid multiple times every day, I would worry about the hinge area. It feels like every other sub $500 laptop, but that is what this is.Windows Home on a ""PRO"" laptop. I didn't use Windows, but I would expect something labeled as pro and for business to have the ability to join a domain out of the box.A con for me is a cdrom drive. That area could have been better utilized as a space for a second storage drive. Most of the cdroms put in laptops are crap that break with any use.I would buy this laptop again for my use case."	3	9	2	8	3

"I bought this computer a month ago and I love it!! It is simple and easy to set up. At first I was afraid I bought the screen too big (I got the 17"") but it is perfect when writing a paper and doing research. I can have two windows open at the same time and easily read both screens. The speed of it is fast and I have never had a frustrating moment with it. I'm in nursing school so I use it daily for several hours at a time. Perhaps my only small complaint is the charge doesn't hold as long as some computers I've used in the past, it will still last several hours but within a few hours it's going dead. Also the fan in it is sometime a little noisy, it never last long, but the first time it did it in class I just thought it was a little loud. Overall I'm very happy I purchased this computer and didn't spend a fortune. It makes school work so much easier!! I definitely would recommend this laptop to anyone!!"	4	2	1	8	6

I would give 5 stars to the hardware but the OS still have lot of bugs right click on web pages is not working at all and I have to do it from touch screen just like on a tab or mobile as most if not all detect this laptop as a mobile or a tab. Hope they will fix these issues with future OS upgrades.Pros: lovely screen, works very fast, long barry life, small size.Cons: poor paint work (very very easily gets stretch marks) , poor hinge (when you touch screen is shaking making it hard to work with), poor keyboard ( feels like you are typing on a toy laptop), no way to insert a SIM card like on other chromebooks.	1	1	0	1	4
"This computer is amazingly light. Honestly I was shocked the first time I picked it up, it's that light. It's amazing that they can fit such a well performing large screened laptop and have it be this light. The screen is beautiful. Hardly any bezels too so it's pretty much all screen. The keyboard is nice and comfortable with a nice clickiness, not mushy like others. The trackpad is very responsive. Just as good as any other laptop I have used, including Macs. The specs are spot on for probably 90% of people. The 8th gen i5 is the brand new 2018 processor and it's fast! 8 gig of ram is more than enough for your average user. 256gb SSD hard drive is fast and a good size, I would say it's more than enough space for the normal casual user. Tons of ports including the most current usb-c. While I have not run any ""tests"" on the battery life it seems pretty insane. LG quotes 19 hours and I have been getting that and a little more even. It's nice to be able to not have ""plug anxiety"" and always have to worry about being near a plug for power. So far this laptop has powered through literally everything I have thrown at it. I installed Office 2016 and it handles excel, word, powerpoint, etc. with ease. I typically have a lot of tabs open while I'm browsing and it has never slowed down. I love watching Netflix on the large high def screen. Overall a super laptop for a great price that will meet the needs of 90% of users. Highly recommended!"	3	5	2	3	3

Just got this computer 3 days ago.. it's blazing fast, feels solid and looks good.. the aluminum body gives it a premium feel and I love it..so far everything is working as it should.. battery seems to last a lot, but probably because i'm comparing to my 6 years old laptop that had only like an hour o so.. anyway, I'm very happy with my purchase and recommends to anyone looking for a new ultrabook..	2	5	2	3	4

First off, I read all the reviews. Some were good, some were bad. I thought that there were more good then bad so I decided to buy this. WORST MISTAKE EVER! The camera is busted. The “refurbished” is broken. They didn’t fix it right. I contacted the seller, and as you can guess, IM STUCK WITH THIS AND NOW HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW LAPTOP. People don’t care about warranties on their products	3	1	0	0	2
I got a blue laptop, but it wasn't what I ordered at all. I specifically chose this laptop because of the number keys on the right, but I received a regular laptop. When I called there was nothing they could do, but remove the picture from the description...at least that's what they said they would do and got a $30 Amazon only items gift card...do you know how hard it was to actually find something I needed that was sold specifically from Amazon??? I was not happy with this purchase at all!!	2	0	0	1	2

After reading mixed reviews, I decided to wait a few months before posting a review. I use this laptop almost every single day. It has been great. There haven't been any problems. I have always had Dell PCs. Rarely have I had any problems with them. Dell is usually pretty good at helping customers resolve any PC issues.The bottom line is that I am very happy with this laptop.	3	4	1	8	3
I love this computer. It boots quickly, has no noisy fan, it's fast and easy to use. My husband has one too and we both love them. This is a simple computer for someone who loves to browse the web and download pictures. It took me a day or two to learn my way around on it, but now it's easy. All you do is sign in with your gmail address and you're on! Great price for a computer.	2	1	0	0	4
I received it Thursday. Following the instructions, I plugged it in and left it alone to charge. I came home from work Friday so excited to get on my new laptop. I turned it on, it uploaded updates, told it I preferred English and selected Express Config instead of Custom. It didn't take long. Quickly it asked me to log into Microsoft or set up an account. I got half of my email address enter and the screen went black. I can see the mouse, that's it. Left it alone, nothing. Rebooted, nothing. I open the warranty booklet and it says to go to their website for customer support info. Seriously. What if this was my only computer? Luckily, I have a phone I can look it up, but my mother doesn't. What would she do. So I look it up, hoping its an easy fix. One quick phone call and I'm ready to go for the weekend. Woot. But I won't know until next week because their support desk is only open Mon-Fri. Seriously. There is an email address and I can leave a message, which is nice. But how freaking frustrating. If/when I get the computer to function I will update this to a review of the actual product. But since I can't use it, all I can review is a complete lack to contact anyone today about the computer that didn't work basically out of the box.UPDATE: Several hours later it occurred to me to go to their website. Not the one they put in the warranty book, their normal site. I found a live chat there. It took over an hour to get someone, but then it was in fact the simple fix I hoped for. Hard reboot while holding F2. Yay. So, I'm still mildly annoyed by the whole process, but I have a laptop now. For now, I'm sticking with 3 stars because the material they provide in the box for what to do with a problem is WRONG. Don't go to the commercial Asus site. Just go to Asus.com.	3	9	2	8	3

Terrific laptop. An an Apple fan, I was happily surprised how easy it was to navigate this device. And it is powerful and fast.

This laptop is way over-powered for my basic and simple home business needs, so I may be in a small subset of users who really have no serious complaints at all. It works as expected. I do not do any gaming whatsoever and hate anything to do with touch screen, so this unit is near-ideal in specs and performance. I have never preferred laptops over a desktop in general, but I like the size of this one and the keyboard is okay, and better than many that I have tried. The set-up was straightforward and I like the fact that it does not come with a lot of excess, unwanted software (bloatware). I love having that DVD-RW drive. Plug it in, turn it on, update the Windows version, download Firefox (in my case), and you are in business. Battery life has been good, as expected. It is a good value for the price and all that it will do, and I would give 5 stars if the screen and materials were a little higher quality, as well as the speakers.	3	9	2	8	3

I've been a Lenovo fan for years because their more expensive laptops come with beautiful matte or anti-glare screens. This laptop however is not just glossy. It is more of a mirror than a laptop. I can see my reflection in the screen when it is at full brightness!It may be OK if you only work in a dim room with no windows and no bright lights.	3	5	2	3	3
Great product for the price. I had no issues with the setup and it was up and running within 30 minutes. Although, not a gaming laptop, it can still play older games. I have had it for a couple of months now and I have not had a single issue. Speakers are not the best quality which is why I gave it 4/5 stars.	3	9	2	8	3
The Samsung Chromebook Plus is almost perfect for me. The only things missing are GPS, backlit keyboard, and a second camera to take pics while in tablet mode. The pen isn't the S-Pen that I am used to from the Note series phones, but it works. I like the keyboard/touchpad layout, similar to a regular laptop, but it is chiclet keys. They have a good typing feel, though. The screen is nice and bright, and wonderfully detailed.The reason I bought the product was because I needed to be able to take notes in class (writing), type up papers and such, and maybe play a few games. Unfortunately, the S-Note app from Samsung Note phones isn't available (um, Samsung? Please?), but there are similar Android and Chrome apps available. Thanks to the active pen, I can write on the screen without my hand making errant marks on the screen.The battery life is excellent, and it can go from 0% to full in about 2 hours. It uses USB-C, and there is a connection on both sides of the device. The plug that comes with it is hard wired, but it will charge with a cord and charger block too.All in all, I love my new chromebook, and I would recommend it.	1	1	0	1	4

PC laptop was shipped early, came in good shape. Everything was included as purchased. I am using it now and it performs very fast. I have only HP computers so I expected to get a good product. It came with HP Elite Premium Support; I had a question so I called the help number - as they advertised there are no phone trees and a real English speaking person answered the phone. I had no hassle with him, no need to identify myself - he just started helping me. The reason I called was because Windows 10 sometimes messes up with the initial password - which defaults to a Microsoft e-mail. I had that problem and had to restart and recover the system from the backup D: drive on the system. It restored perfectly and I was very careful in setting up the initial password to be sure that I had the correct password for the Microsoft e-mail account. Everything is fine now. The HP agent stayed with me until I knew everything was working perfectly. BTW, the price for the laptop was very good - I did a lot of checking of other sites before I purchased from Amazon.	2	7	3	8	7
"After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for. While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone's mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain? 2) is it worth the premium price? 3) why isn't USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design: The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL). This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy. You can open the lid with one finger. In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops. The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard. Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4's. It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors. Sounds wonderful. But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad. So, how long can alcantara last? A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time. Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards. Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard.""Is this worth all your beer money?"" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It's not that you can't get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time. Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range. Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn't a single comparable Windows laptop out there. I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience. In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure. This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain. Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store. When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet. Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go). To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn't Microsoft put in some USB-C ports? For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds). Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future. Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing. What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C. This creates a big headache for the consumer. If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work. More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A). In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of ""having something that works today"" vs. ""having something that will work in the future but probably not today."" It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port. In my mind, I'm okay with not having the USB-C port. USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I'm not very big on carrying multiple dongles. As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for: This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don't require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies). Engineers might want to double check their schools' recommendation before taking the plunge. If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you! I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier. I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions."	2	7	2	3	3

I bought this computer for my son for College, it was delivered to him on August 30th. It is now December 24th and the screen decided to go out on half of the computer. What a piece of junk!

Works well as a chromebook.Pen:The pen seems forced and is more for novelty than true samsung pen usage. It's only good for drawing on the drawing app. The google handwriting recognition is a bit odd to use but works well.Google apps:I use this primarily as a chromebook but with a 12.5 inch screen, it's great for reading marvel unlimited comics after you download the marvel unlimited app from the app store. I've found that most android apps have better web versions so I've only ended up using marvel unlimited and teamviewer as the apps I use primarily with this. Other apps like google music would be great to use as apps since you can control it from the notification area instead of having to switch to the tab.Media:It plays netflix (website) and plex (website) videos very well. I haven't really tried the apps for both of them on this device. I was able to use this device with a usb-c to hdmi connector and watched a couple of shows on an external monitor. It was clear and had no stuttering problems that I typically get from my asus rockchip chromebook. I was on a couple of social media websites, an image site and a chat site while this was going on so that I could watch while I did other things too.What I don't like.So far, being nitpicky, the pen doesn't do anything. I haven't been able to try and install the galaxy note apps on it so that i can try that and the google play store on chrome OS does not support some games.	1	1	0	1	4
I am in the process of returning my purchase due to constant irritating running noise, not sure if it's the hard drive or the cooling fan, but it's extremely annoying, especially if you like to work in a very quiet environment.

"Arrived today (2-21-18)....not impressed by how cheap the feel of this laptop is, I can get over that. I plugged in the charger, powered up/configured account information....noticed response time was a bit sluggish but I continued to install email/dropbox and windows updates, walked away from this laptop for a few hours came back and my dropbox was transfering via (LAN @ 1Gb) at 1 Gig per hour, that's nuts (way to slow)...noticed that the hard drive activity was at 100% did the usual stopping of services like windows search, Background Intel and Skype uninstall, but still this 100% hard drive activity won't go away, even after a reboot the computer is sluggish even at the login screen, after a few hours of troubleshooting I decided to reset the OS back to factory and see what that does. As you can see in the pictureI did the reset, and that seemed to fix the 100% hard drive activity, now a physical issue and unfortunately there is nothing that can be done, a 2TB-2.5inch HDD spins at 5400 rpm and that really slows up the performance of this machine the RAM and CPU are skating along and the HDD is at 100% and overheating, installing a SSD drive would solve this issue but storage is still expensive, a 250Gb SSD is under $100, and good luck taking this computer apart also, you can't add a second physical drive in this as another reviewer stated it did, I saw a video from HP on the previous model to this and the insides of this are packed tight. so I stopped removing the back cover I didn't have the right pry tool to seperate the case and I really didn't want pry marks all over thisAnother issue, windows updates is taking forever.....it's doing the feature update and the computer is at 0% updated after 45 mins and yes there is a HDD light/indicator on this....of course it's on the side of the unit so you have to look around the monitor to see it and it's lit and chugging away thanks to the 5400 rpm HDD in a fast machine (it took 4 1/2 hours to do this win10 features update)I will give this laptop a few days and make my judgement call, but I am going to start the paperwork for the return on this unit, I'm not an optimist with this computer but, I will give it a chanceThe Pro's: Excellent CPU, the benchmarks on this is what made me decide to purchase it, also 12Gb RAMThe Con's: read everything above the Pro'sEven with the reset OS and the physical limitations of the HDD This machine should be faster than it is, I have a few 5400 rpm hard drives in much older computers than this and they are okay in speed, a lot faster than this. I am now thinking there is something physically wrong with the hardware or hard drive another reviewer stated he had the same issues and seems now so do I, time to do another OS reset and back to Amazon it goes (after a few days), and no I will not recommend this to a friend or enemy and I will not purchase this again. Back to Acer or Toshiba no more HP's great name, crap laptopUpdate 2-23-18: I am trying really hard to like this computer, I uninstalled Crapavee AntiSpeed What they call Anti-Virus and other things that I don't need but I like Movie Maker and you can still download it and when I did called ""Microsoft Essentials 2012"" it took 10 minutes to install. when this laptop updated to the latest win10 feature it took 4 and 1/2 hours, don't think of multi-tasking on this machine just watch the task manager hard drive activity, it will always zoom to 100% while the CPU and RAM are surfing along with no effort, maybe I'm spoiled by the SSD drives, but watching the task manager tells me the brick wall on this laptop is the 5400 rpm hard drive.Final Update: I purchased a Samsung 850 Evo 250G SSD Drive, removed the sluggish 5400 HDD, installed the Samsung SSD (see pic) downloaded from Microsoft Win 10 ISO burned to DVD and USB Installed OS in 15 minutes...(wow) Installed updates (super fast) went to activation and it was already activated through my Microsoft account but it was the Win10 Home edition, I have Win7 Pro so I added my product key and now this HP-SSD Upgrade Laptop has Win10 Pro. This laptop is now super fast (it should be) with the $96 SSD drive and I will purchase a USB3 external drive case for the factory 2TB HDDand use it for my 1TB Dropbox as well as data. I now have a great computer for $627.64 ...the cover isn't really that hard to remove just to let you know under the rubber feet there is a screw below each pad.if you are willing to work with it and changing out the HDD for a SSD this computer is well worth the cost of $627.64and I did a benchmark test and with the SSD drive this computer is highly ratedLast Thoughts: I spent too much time to get this laptop to this level (I'm typing this update on it) but it is the fastest computer you can get for the price, I have a 8 year old desktop and this laptop is taking its place and after working on this laptop for a few days then going to my desktop there is no comparison, this laptop is a keeper. I use Photoshop and this laptop processes fast ..... it's good to see the RAM, CPU and SDD are all on the same workload"	3	5	2	9	3

If you're looking for a computer that does anything besides basic stuff, you should look elsewhere. I use it only for writing and it works just fine. The computer is light and barely noticeable, durable (a necessity in my line of work), and has a long battery life. The casing feels a bit cheap, but can't complain because the reason I bought it is because my other laptop is so heavy. Basically, you get what you pay for; it does it's job for the price it is.	2	1	0	1	7

I have toyed with tablets since my old IBM thinkpad died, and finally decided to get a small laptop. I had a few reservations, but ordered it on Tuesday the 4th of July. I couldn't believe it got here on the 6th. I charged it, downloaded Office, and played around on it a little. I left it unplugged from Thursday until this evening (Saturday). I have been typing away for an hour or so, downloaded some stuff, and I still have 8 hours left on the battery. I am impressed with the keyboard and the look of the unit.Update: I still have 6+ hours of battery left after leaving it unplugged overnight. I also wanted to comment on how nice it was to get Office pre-installed. the track pad is very sensitive, and although I bought a wireless mouse I haven't felt like I needed it yet.	2	0	0	1	5

"I am very impressed with this so far. I managed to run GTA V Online smoothly on this pc at ""normal"" graphics settings. That's pretty impressive for the price as it is a very system demanding game. Plus, it looks pretty sleek. The battery doesn't last long if it's not plugged in but it's not intended to. This pc is intended for performance which takes power. If you need something that is going to have a long battery life for hanging out online or doing homework, you'll want to choose something different. We have only had it a week so I will update with any issues that arise.Dropping this rating to 3 stars. After just under 2 months of use - the keyboard stopped working. I tried to update the driver, was up to date. Tried to reinstall the driver, that did not repair it. Then I made the mistake of just shutting it down. Well...the power button is ON THE KEYBOARD. That means, once shut down, I was unable to turn it back on. It's now being sent in for repairs.Bumping this back to 4 stars because acer repair was very fast. However, they asked that I send the pc in the original packaging, but did not send it back to me in the original packaging, so now I no longer have it should anything else go wrong."	3	6	3	3	0

User observations on the ASUS VivoBook S:The Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz processor lets me bring up applications far more quickly than on any computer I have had before.Even though the laptop frame size is what traditionally has house a 14” monitor, the narrow bezel allows it to hold a 15.6” monitor it seems larger.There is no wasted space and it uses almost the entire monitor, making for an impressively large picture.The picture is super crisp with very sharp images.The aesthetics are great. It is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops I’ve had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.My only complaint is that the Delete key is right next to the Power button. This, according to Murphy’s Law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on. For this reason, I give this computer four stars. Aside from that, I loved it.	3	7	2	8	4
Simply a worry free, great device	1	1	0	1	4
"My first impressions where Wow, woa & WoW! But then I was shocked when I noticed the device would simply shut down if I put it on its side. Don't get me wrong It is really sharp looking and seems fast. It has a slick looking responsive touchscreen that is about the size of a regular piece of paper and nice contours. I thought to myself this can basically do everything I need. Sure I would have to ""adapt"" to the samsung power chord and adjust to doing all my work via apps and the cloud but that seemed kind of exciting. And, my first doodles with the s-pen weren't worth saving though I looked forward to the many drawing sessions I dreamed of. Unfortunately the beautiful device that my samsung chromebook is, it still has an issue with turning off when on its side in tablet mode. It whites out and turns off if I simply set it up right on it's side. So, I am once again heartbroken by a samsung product, like the note 7, That had everything I needed but one crucial part and now I am left without an option other than to buy from another manufacturer once again."	1	1	0	1	4

Being a console gamer all my life I finally wanted to try some PC gaming. After researching over 7 laptops for a month I finally found this one. I had to research what graphics cards and cores and processors were. So yea I'm a noob lol. It after owning this for almost a month now I can say it is the best PC I've ever had. It's fast and plays games really well. Have not had any issues. Yes the screen is a TN panel so it's matte instead of glossy, however it's still really good and worth the price. Overall great product and especially if your new to pc gaming like me.	3	7	2	8	0

I needed a Windows computer in order to make some configuration changes to IoT devices around the house using a USB cable. It took about 6 hours to get the pre-installed Windows 10 up to the most recent updates/patches/etc. Probably 6 reboots along the way. Then I was only left with about 1GB of disk space, which wasn't enough to do much of anything with additional software loading. Here is what I did to make it more usable: 1) Uninstall the bloatware/adware as much as possible using the control panel UI. 2) Look for Windows 10 powershell commands to remove the rest. 3) Remove the previous version of Windows to free up additional space. This was able to net me a couple more GB, and make things usable again. Otherwise the device is fine. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that would be rarely used, so the price was right. The touchpad mouse is a bit clumsy for clicking with no separate button, so I found it easier to use a corded mouse with it. WiFi was fine. Screen was fine. So in the end, it's just OK, but usable for what I needed.	2	0	0	1	2

I did my research when I went purchased this laptop last February. I’m a college student that needed to be able to write papers and read assignments on the go, and of course watch a youtube video here and there. This laptop is a nightmare for me - it takes 30 minutes to turn on sometimes, doesn’t last more than 2 hrs off of the charger, and takes forever to load pages/open programs no matter my connection. It crashes on me and starts updates in the middle of use. I’m very unimpressed and super bummed that it didn’t work out. I guess I have to spend more to get something at the bottom level of decent, so it’s partly my fault. I don’t know if these issues would be covered by warranty or anything (maybe I got a faulty one, I dunno), but for now I’m disappointed with the product.	2	0	0	1	5

Technically works. I had modest expectations for this laptop, but it consistently struggled to handle a single chrome tab. Just one. I just wanted to use this for google docs and not have to bother with the weirdness of a chromebook, but this just couldn't handle a single light task with any reasonable speed. Build quality is fine and the laptop looks good, but man, even for a light duty device, this just doesn't cut it.	2	0	0	1	2

Really disappointed with this Chromebook. I had to send it to an authorized repairer here in Australia as after two months the ghost screen taps issue started to occur. I noticed that the underside of the Chromebook got extremely hot as well. After having the LCD and the main board replaced I can say it is working much better with the wifi more stable, no ghost touches, heat issue has reduced and the battery is lasting longer. Hopefully no issue from here on in.I know it is not Samsung's fault but the fact that Chome OS blocks 3rd party apps from accessing external storage is a real killer and I would have re-thought this purchase had I known this in advance. There is still hope that a Chrome OS update will allow it.	1	1	0	1	4
Decent laptop overall, but great laptop on a budget. Does feel pretty plasticky, but it’s ok. My only problem is with the WiFi repeatedly switching, but that can be solved with an Ethernet cable. It can run Minecraft with intense shaders, Planet Coaster (although frames are dropped), Fortnite, PUBG, and everyday tasks well. Video processing should be ok if it is light, but it might not be able to handle intense graphic editing. Overall great laptop for the price.	3	6	3	3	0

Received the laptop checked everything on it so far it is great just a reminder you must have knowledge about computers it has a few things you have to go thru and update and sign on if your DVD player is not working and it keeps telling you to go to app store down load Kodi from app store then your dvd will play or find a tech geek to help you. Because it only comes with standard apps but it's a great laptop.	3	9	2	8	6
I facilitated this purchase, for an undergrad. Fantastic computer, for the price. It's very hard to go wrong, with Lenovo.	3	1	0	7	5
Do not buy this. I must have received a lemon because the reviews were pretty good but this computer is horrible. Seemed okay at first, pretty slow but that was to be expected at the price point. Well after just a couple of months and not storing much on it at all, it takes an hour for it to load up and to complete a simple task. I can't get anything done with this and it was the a waste of money. I knew that I should have paid a little more to get a quality laptop but I got duped by the reviews so hopefully I can save some of you all the trouble. Also, I contacted customer support to try to resolve the issue before I wrote a bad review but no one ever answered me. Was just outside the return window or I would have definitely sent it back.	3	2	1	8	7

Been using this product since the 15th and it's working pretty well so far. It's fast, smooth, the stylus pen is a nice touch and I'm rediscovering my passion for drawing again. However, here are some things to look out for:CAPSLOCK; If you don't want to deal with the Alt + search way of turning capslock on/off, Go to Settings > Device> Keyboard and change the search button to function as the CAPSLOCK key alone. You can also customize the other main keys as you wish.No backlit keyboard. For $400+, it would have been nice.Smaller than I thought it would be, but that's mainly on me.	1	1	0	1	4

Works fine. Plays the games I need it to play. Boots fast. Like the lighted keyboard, however, the keyboard is VERY hard to see without the power supply plugged supply because the lighted keyboard only work with the power supply attached.

It's nice but the pen experience is horrible and frustrating 😤. I've lost so much hair trying to use onenote with the pen. No palm rejection. Can't use portrait mode with a maximized window.

It's light though which is great.I'd say this is worth more like $300 tops.	1	1	0	1	4

Although it functions quite well the chassis wasn't metal, and the outter case was so poorly designed that the hinges of the screen act as levers to split it appart using nothing more than the screen's own weight. I've had to use lots of super glue just to keep it together since I cannot afford another PC. I had a toshiba laptop before this with slightly worse specs for 3 years, and only had to replace that because the charging port of the motherboard died (tried just replacing the piece but was a no go). Considering I haven't had this one even a year and it's given so much trouble (started within a month but was managabe) I can't recommend this PC if you plan on actually keeping one for any decent length of time.	3	9	3	8	0
This is an excellent budget lap top. The build quality is good for the price, the color options and design are really nice given the price. It is lighter than other laptops that have the same sized screen, which is important when your wife is small. The laptop is not the quickest on the market, but if you know how to set up your laptop correctly after getting it out of the box, the lag is not noticeable. I bought this as a basic laptop companion, so we basically use it for internet, email and streaming videos. Those functions run smoothly on the device. We do not do anything heavy on the laptop. The keys are responsive and the screen appears sharp.	3	0	0	8	2

I have had some problems with my device among which are the heat produced which is much higher than I expected because in some reviews mentioned that I had a good thermal solution, the problem is that by playing about two hours the device gives a few pulls and you can not continue with the games session, another issue is that my device brings two 4GB RAM memories and usually usually comes with only one of 8GB leaving a slot free and then add another if necessary but in my case I must buy two if I need 16gb of ram, the network card on the other hand is quite slower than I expected since I have the same card in another device and it gives me quite good speed however with this barely and it helps me web browsing, I tried to reinstall the drivers that previously had updated but has not had any effect, otherwise everything is fine and I guess the defects that have i machine does not have to occur in other devices of the same series however it is a point to take into account since they can not launch equipment with these defects without a previous revision of them.	3	7	2	8	0
Fantastic product. I already have given 3 of these to 3 of my daughter's and i got this one for my wife. Wish i came here first, i would have saved alot more money.

My girls are completely thoughtless in what they download and these computers have proven to be impervious to this over the past 6 months.	3	1	0	0	2
Surprisingly good for the money!This unit, the (HP Notebook Laptop 15.6 HD Vibrant Display Quad Core AMD E2-7110 CPU 1.8GHz 4GB RAM 500GB HDD DVD Windows 10) is a great starter for any home, student or office. Sporting Windows 10 is a great addon considering other computer offerings down in this price range which offer windows 7 if anything at all.As is, it's good for most tasks including some photo editing and processing. Handles the web and email with ease, simultaneously I might add. Will even run all that while working in Word and using rather large spreadsheets in excel!This unit is versatile and with a few cheap upgrades, will perform exactly like a $1,000.00 laptop.I'd recommend upgrading the ram to 8GB and the hard drive with a small SSD hard drive for speed, or a large fast 7200 rpm notebook drive. Once those are done, you've got something more than capable for almost anything you'd want to do with it.HP as always, great service and support along with great quality that will last you easily 4-6 years if you take care of it. Highly Recommend!	3	0	0	7	5
Replaced an older Asus netbook with this. This is a very nice laptop for general use. Switched to Win 10 Pro from S right away. It took about 2.5 hours to complete. It had 38 GB free on the HD while in S mode, but after switching to Pro, it only has 13 GB free. I tested the latest release of Ubuntu (18.04) on it and it runs well. Everything works. The only negative thing I can say about this laptop is the lack of storage space after switching to Pro, but that is because Windows 10 is so bloated.	2	9	0	2	2

Got this computer (512 gb SSD, 16 gb RAM) a day ago and it's pretty much everything I wanted and more. Has all the ports I need for school with the power to play games whenever I have extra time. I haven't really dealt with the display too much because I use an external monitor but from what I've seen so far the display is pretty decent.The only gripe I have is that the fans get fairly loud when you're working the CPU too hard but other than that it's been a great purchase. I got the ASUS equivalent about half a month back and was incredibly unsatisfied with that laptop. You are definitely making a great choice in getting this one.	3	7	3	8	0

The touchpad (while sensitive enough) is delayed by the hardware. Everything is delayed. Plan your key strokes and mouse clicks a couple seconds ahead, and for the love of gosh, don't make mistakes, as correcting them takes an eternity. I'm used to a completely equipped mid 2014 MBP, an SDD upgraded Mac Mini, and a completely equipped Lenovo AIO. This sucks. I got it to prepare for the upcoming likely every country laptop ban so I can stuff it in my backpack and not care if TSA steals it, but now I kind of hope TSA steals it. I really only got it to use for mild work when I'm not not supposed to be working for email and remote desktop into my quickbooks server. Remote desktop works pretty ok, because it's realying omn the remote hardware, but man, I don't know if I can do it. Amazon doesn't allow returns of open boxes, but I'd return it if I could.	2	0	0	1	5
A great gaming laptop, but not the best. I would not recommend this product because of the LCD screen is cheap and very bad. However, the graphics and gameplay are magnificent because of the Intel Core i7 and NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX. The battery life is okay, but you would definitely want to take your charger with you when you're going somewhere with it. The design looks normal and it's not that heavy, which makes this laptop easy to travel with and even take it to your work place or school. There are way more better gaming laptops than this. Although, the graphics are magnificent on this, the LCD screen is trash. This just hurts my eyes after few hours of playing GTA V. Pros: All the games run smoothly and the audio quality is quite good. Cons: Am awful screen for a gaming laptop.	3	9	3	8	0

"TL:DR on bottomIt's a fantastic little laptop for students. It's super light weight, decent power, and has a long battery life (mine was used and still has a 13hr battery life). However, there are a few little kinks that prevent it from becoming a 5-star product. The first and foremost, when you are charging your battery it seems to have a noticeable impact on the processing power, for example, it's seamless when streaming 720p on YouTube, but when plugged in, it starts to have latency issues, and you will have to either wait until the video completely loads or go down to 480p. There was also an issue with my unit where the ""R"" key is slightly off, so if you press it in the wrong spot it wont register. Lastly, the memory is very small, so a flash drive is going to be mandatory. Other than that, its a super nice laptop. Clean, functional, quick, long battery and light (both in weight and brightness).TL:DR = Strongly suggest if you need a casual laptop for school, it's not a gaming laptop, and get a flash drive for it."	2	0	0	1	5
Seems like a great unit have always liked Dell. The power plug is smaller than my older units, but I expect great durability. Bought this to replace my work laptop which died after 5 years of abuse! This is my third Dell I expect it last just as long. Has touch screen which doesn't seem to sensitive, the whole thing is very lite and has mosterous storage capacity. 2 freaking Terabytes! I've already had it grinding away for a few hours transfer a couple hundred gigs of data! The other reviews say its slow I have not noticed that, but DELL did install alot of crap that I don't use mostly antivirus and support programs. Great laptop at a great price !	3	9	3	9	3

"I absolutely love this laptop. I went with the 16GB RAM, 512SSD, i7 version. So, in my opinion the top of the line. I'm an engineering student and I had an okay Dell laptop for a couple of years after my initial Lenovo laptop completely failed on me. The laptop I had was a midrange i5 inspiron that just wasn't fast enough and the start time on it was horrible.I've had this laptop for the last few months and I can run any software I want on it and it's lightning fast. I can run Matlab, compile and run C code, or even do a simulation in Ansys or Solidworks (mainly thanks to the 16GB RAM). If you're borderline between this laptop and maybe like an Acer or Lenovo with similarly impressive hardware stats that's maybe a little cheaper I would absolutely recommend paying a bit more for this laptop. The quality is superb, the specs can't be beat, and the price is extremely reasonable.I haven't tried out any gaming on it yet to check on the graphics card, but with a 4GB Nvidia graphics card, the performance is probably fantastic.The display is great, backlit keyboard is awesome, and for being considered a ""gaming"" laptop it doesn't look to gawdy.I don't care if you're a gamer or not - I'm not - this laptop (with the specs I have) really can't be beat.Okay, now that you found this laptop after searching and wading through reviews and specs for possibly days you can finally stop searching. It's the real deal."	3	7	3	3	0

This is a very sturdy and solid laptop, that is one thing I like about Dell laptops. Aside from the specs, the screen is well suited for gaming since it has a higher response rate than IPS screens. Recently have upgrade my 8GB Ram with another 8GB ballistics Crucial Ram totalling to 16GB and upgraded to a 2 TB Seagate with the extra cache included. Response time is amazing. Only left is to put the SSD. One thing though... When i was taking off the HDD bracket.. Three screws were locked so tight that i had to precisely cut the bracket so i can have at least half of it to put it back with the newly upgraded HDD. Now.. Dell.. Unfortunately wamted me to pay to it the service. Even under warranty within the first month and a half ..it is technically a defect, and they want me to fork over forty something dollars and send it to the service center also, and i can't do it cause i am in college.. Although i would not take a star away.. but i really dislike dell costumer service because of this..	3	7	3	8	0

What can I say? From the leather like feel of the palm rest, to the amazingly vibrant screen, to the crazy battery life, this is one darn good machine. Battery Life - I work in Word, Excel, Outlook and OneNote all day long, and using those programs (with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth on, Display at recommended, and power at recommended) I am receiving 16-18 hours of battery life. When I browse the internet in my free time I get closer to 12-14 hours, so high internet usage will drain your battery faster, but still, those are some amazing numbers.Display - Bright, vibrant colors. I have never had a problem reading anything, even outdoors.Keyboard and trackpad - there is a tiny bit of keyboard flex, but the keys are fine, and the trackpad is wow. The same glass trackpad as the Surface Book (read amazing)OS - I have yet to require an app outside of the Windows Store, but if you do, grab your free update to Windows 10 Pro.Graphics - can do basic gaming, but no powerhouse.Overall - great machine	2	8	2	3	3

Product worked well and was very satisfied. However, updates indicated a Windows 10 update and after we ran the update, we had no sound. Despite hours of downloading drivers and researching the issue, still no sound. So the brand new computer will need service.

I got burned on the original Surface when it came out (I had an RT which was horrible, so I traded for a Pro with Win8). That Surface got slower and slower with its many, many updates, to where the system was so bogged down that it was unusable. On top of that, hardware challenges began to show after a few weeks and by month three I loved it a lot less than on Day One. So I waited a few months before reviewing this laptop to see if it had similar issues.Fortunately, Microsoft seems to have ironed out a lot of the issues. This laptop may not have all the cool-hip factor of a convertible tablet, but its full-sized keyboard and solid casing are eminently practical while its feather weight and ultra-slim profile still keep it in the fashionably-cool category. Mine has and i5 processor and 8GB of RAM and that seems adept at most things I do (it's only a little sluggish with some games like Forza 6 and with Access). Were I chronically trying to do either, I would splurge for the i7/16GB, but the entry set will work for most tasks.The keyboard is responsive. My only gripe is my 30-year history of right-handed Control+Enter is busted by this keyboard's layout, which replaces the right control key with a menu key and no easy way to re-map it. It is backlight, but more a hint of backlit than my VAIO or Alienware, which actually makes it more eye-friendly in the dark. The large track pad is very responsive and reads the full range of touch and swipe options (some of which are turned off my default - weird).The aluminum case is sharp looking, though my dented pretty easily while in my laptop bag with my mouse. The power cord attach is magnetic, with a bar clip that makes aligning it a snap (ba da ch!). I will say the battery default power setting lets it drain pretty quickly, so if you're like me and use yours while flying, you may consider switching to lower-power options (this gets me from about 6 hours of heavy use to 12 - a nice leap, especially considering it's not the fastest charging device).Finally, for what it's worth: I do not like Win10S any more than I liked Win8RT. I know it makes the system lighter, faster, and more Android/iOS-ish, but it also makes it impossible to run my work software, any legacy software, and just in general I reject the idea (been using Microsoft since the DOS 3.0 days, so I guess I'm stuck in the mindset of me telling my computer what it will do, not the other way around). So for my 2 cents, just upgrade to full Windows 10 when you get it. The upgrade is free for the remainder of 2017, and only $50 beginning in 2018 (purchase via the Windows Store).	2	7	2	3	3
Excellent value, super thin and light almost everything work very well including the touchpad (saw reviews that it was stiff but my family is fine with it). The only thing that could be a bit better is the quality of the IPS screen. I would have paid +$50 for a better monitor. But totally do not regret the purchase and would probably buy it again.	2	5	2	3	4

My daughter’s HP laptop started giving up the ghost and she needed a replacement fairly quickly. I have had great luck with Acer laptops in the past so I thought I would try the Acer Nitro 5.My first impression is that this laptop was a bit bigger and heavier than most of the laptops I have purchased in recent years. The casing feels to be mostly of plastic. While it is solid and sturdy feeling, it does give it a bit of a cheap feeling.My daughter mainly uses the PC for academics and light gaming. For this, the PC has performed superbly.The only thing I thought was just OK was the sound quality. I know that laptops generally do not have good sound quality, but I thought the speakers and sound in this laptop were a bit mediocre. The sound was not terrible, but it sure was not excellent either.Personally, I loved the HD screen on this PC. The light up keyboard is a nice touch I thought. Battery life runs about 5 to 6 hours with surfing and online use.After about 6 months of use, the laptop is still running like a champ. I have yet to encounter an issue.Overall, I have been very happy with this laptop. I would highly recommend this latptop for someone looking for a good laptop at a good price.	3	6	3	3	0
Bought this as a Xmas gift. Worked for 20 minutes then died. Won't power up, nothing completely dead. Thought maybe it was in hibernation mode but alas its dead. Will try to get a refund, no desire to get a replacement.	2	0	0	1	5

The bad: it scuffs easily.The good: super slim, convertible, great display, seems to keep getting better with frequent OS updates (the unlock-by-phone feature only worked intermittently when I first purchased, now it works about 90% of the time?). Comes with a lot of freebies (6 months of Netflix, etc).	1	1	0	1	4
I was looking for something cheap but of value for someone. I was very skeptical about the laptop. When I get it, it run very slow, like really slow, snail slow. You get the idea. So I decided to open the bottom and swapped the HDD for an SSD that cost me 60 bucks. This thing becomes as fast as my $1000 laptop. I highly recommend you change the HDD for an SSD or you'll be pulling your hair ( I'm getting bald BTW)	3	2	1	8	7

If u want to edit videos on this then 1080p videos with the added ssd is smooth most of the time. Ultra HD 4k gets annoying but if it's under 4 minutes then it's manageable. Can't edit 4k video with out horrible playback	3	7	3	8	3

I have never written a review before, but I am shocked to see all the extremely good reviews for this product. I had only had the laptop for about 2 days when it began having a problem. When i opened the laptop from sleep mode it was backlit but black. I tried many different ways to wake it up, turn it off, and let the battery die. The problem persisted for a while until I finally was able to bring up the login screen and shut it down not using the power button, but the on screen button. Further, the track pad has the common pinch and zoom capability but constantly zooms in and out when I am just moving the cursor. But the lag on the track pad is also a issue because then I try and correct the zoom but because of the 4 or 5 second lag it ends up overcompensating the other way. As well, the scrolling function of the track pad is horrible. It either jumps 10 pages or moves incredibly slowly. Applications take ages to open and I have not added a single one on here nor anything other than what came on the laptop, so it will only get slower from here. I am absolutely returning. I had the $150 samsung chromebook before this but needed excel. However, that chromebook was far superior to this.	2	0	0	1	5

Not sure about the negative comments on this computer I got this for $300.00 and I believe it is well worth the price It came with a 1tb drive and 8gb of ram ( up gradable to 16gb ) and works a treat. It runs Fallout 4 reasonable well and runs Metro 2033 on high settings just fine. No it's not a gaming beast but for 300 it's a steal. Well satisfied customer here. Very fast shipping. Sorry a few of you had lemons.Cons. None as yet.	3	2	1	8	7

Really good laptop, especially if you can find the sale for $150 off. Absolutely cannot beat the value.Runs Fortnite at a consistent 95 fps with shadows and anti-aliasing at lowest setting, with everything else set for the highest setting (very powerful cpu and gpu). Has more than enough storage to hold all your games and other files. Boots up super fast.Looks great, keys are smooth, display is great.Kinda heavy, but not an issue for most people.I saw reviews saying that theirs came with dead pixels, mine did not.Definitely happy with this purchase.	4	8	3	8	0

SUPER slow. If you were hoping to buy a product that comes basically ready to use right out of the box: don't buy this product.

So far this laptop has completely met my expectations. Extremely light yet feels rigid enough, loads all my 3D design software fast and nice. Graphics could be faster... but not for this price tag! I love Windows 10, and particularly the fact it is not Windows 8...The only but I find it that when plugged it generates that weird electric field around the keyboard and behind the screen that you feel when you pass your finger or hand. It is strange, I guess it is because there is no ground on the Power Supply?	2	6	5	4	3
I'm happy with it now but when I received it the os had corrupted files and wasn't working properly, I ended up formatting the drive and doing a clean install of win 10 with a win 10 media flash drive and reinstalling all the driver's to get it running smoothly.	3	7	2	8	0

"4.5 stars if there is such option.I can feel its power when I can use it even in a highly crowded subway train compartment. I turned it into a vertically held tablet, with many pre-loaded tabs opened. I can enjoy the online media contents almost anywhere. When I can sit down in restaurant, I turn it into a laptop doing the assignment or office works. Its versatility is impressive. ASUS Chromebook Flip serve similar purposes, but 10.1"" screen is really too small, and 1200 x 800 resolution is too low for me.(By the way, I rarely use tent mode and stand mode, which are not as good as laptop mode in my opinion. Even so, I think convertible laptop is far more convenient than detachable laptop. Quick and intuitive to transform.)110%+ sRGB, 380+nits... the screen surpass most other laptop/tablet touchscreens (although the new iPad Pro do even better in true-tone and anti-glare). But just keep in mind, if you find yourself rarely use touchscreen, you may find matte finish screen is more attractive to you.Cons:Short key travel, exceptionally small ""backspace"" button, non-backlit keyboard, inefficient use of space above the keyboard, non-movie-friendly 3:2 screen... all these are minor issues to me.But 4GB RAM is a pain to me, especially I like to preload the contents when I have good Wifi access, that consume much RAM. The tab management and session management extensions can't help me much to save RAM.32GB storage is another pain to me that I am forced to delete some downloaded TED and Google Play Movies, and the Android game Final Fantasy Tactics. The microSD can't help on these. 64GB internal storage should be the minimum for Chromebook running Android apps."	1	1	0	1	4

It's ok for the price. I would have hoped the system would have booted faster, and sometimes the system can be slow. But most of the time it is pretty responsive. You will need the expandable memory if you buy this because windows hogs most of the hard drive space. No mechanical problems so far. I haven't tested the webcam. The keyboard is small but nice. I like the touchpad. The display is pretty good but I only have watched 720p video so far.	2	0	0	1	5
Don’t get me wrong: this laptop is light years ahead of any computer I have ever owned. It is slim, light, fast, great looking… I really wanted one that had an SSD and hard drive so I could work quickly but store a lot of photographs and at work. But for streaming video it is terrible – the sound is very quiet and very muffled. I don’t want to have to get external speakers or wear headphones every time I want to watch a show. Haven’t decided if I’m going to return it but I’m very disappointed.	2	7	3	8	3
"Acer Predator 17 Gaming Laptop, Core i7, GeForce GTX 1070, 17.3"" Full HD G-SYNC, 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, G9-793-79V5The Acer Predator G9-793-79V5 is probably the best choice I made for a gaming laptop, I really was tempted to get an Asus ROG but after checking the specs between them I believe this one convinced me. Will try to be as detailed as possible.* THE GOOD:+ 17"" diagonal LCD IPS screen providing native 1920x1080 resolution.+ nVidia GTX 1070 graphics.+ Illuminated keyboard + keypad.+ Hotkey / macro profiles on the left side, switch button allows to store up to 15 macros+ OS very clean, not a lot of bloatware to complain of and the Acer utilities include a wi-fi analyzer which in turn allows to configure better wi-fi channels for better network performance.+ 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key SSD + 1Tb 7200 SATA HD.+ 16Gb RAM out of the box plus 2 easy access slots on the back for expansion.+ USB 3.0 ports layout is good, not spread all over and spaced nicely to connect multiple devices without blocking each other.* THE BAD:- Heavy and large but again its 17"" made for gaming or to replace a desktop so deal with it.- Proper gaming sessions require power brick connected, power brick rated for 230W output.- Quick start guide very simple instructions, you actually need to download the manual to learn most of its tricks.- 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key in RAID-0 configuration. (Read below)- Locked ""InsydeH20"" BIOS. (Read below)- Basic optical media, DVD reader / writer, my previous computer was an HP Pavilion dv6 and could read Blu-Ray discs.Let me give you my biggest beefs to a couple of the ""BAD"" things.* Having 2 SSD drives is a big bonus, but using them in a RAID-0 array its pointless, because they are SSD's, they are fast already and the RAID-0 gain in so minimal that the computer actually wastes time writing on 2 devices instead of 1.* This problem with RAID 0 is compounded due the fact that Acer decided to lock the BIOS so the SATA mode is set to RAID and preventing end users to change it. Again this is a major mistake. In the event of RAID array failure the user cannot reinstall software or may not recover at all since the configuration setting is locked.At this point some of you who know how to work with RAID-0 arrays may think. ""Surely that kind of problem is very rare.""Sadly it is not, before this review I received this same computer and while running it through its paces the RAID array failed.Because RAID was locked in BIOS I could not use an image I made at first and the Acer recovery tools and recovery management were unable to reinstall the software or rebuild the array from scratch.This also prevents users from upgrading to bigger SSD drive sizes, I am unaware of the RAID array will be rebuilt on a bigger SSD drive, plus the SSD slots and space for them may cause problem installing a new SSD. (See pictures)Acer really needs to unlock the BIOS and give the option to the users to configure the computer as they see fit and its not really that hard. After speaking with Acer support he claimed that users can unlock the BIOS but its not Acer's policy to disclose how to do it. So I assume the unlock procedure is just a backdoor or master password to unlock all features.Now a bit on the good side:This is a laptop computer but you want to use it on a table for comfort, when its running at full speed it gets warm BUT the lap portion remains relatively cool. Using the overclocking options the most heat came from the rear away from the lap and even away from the keyboard, even graphic-intensive games were run very smoothly at ""Ultra"" settingsIn the end I think the GOOD overcome the BAD and its a solid purchase for both work and entertainment for the next couple years and if Acer stops trying to tie leashes on the customers it will be a great purchase for everyone else.** 08/12/2017 A bit of more updates. **Around 1 month after I got the computer have used it to convert movies with handbrake and while all 4 cores work at full I see no extra heat coming out from the back, heat output remains at a steady 97F-98F.While people like to use test programs like heaven and others I prefer to use somewhat intensive applications.I run Second life at Ultra settings and Space Engineers online and they both run quite smoothly, very little (if any) visual lag.The most delays I notice is when using the SATA hard drive for the programs but using the SSD's pretty much prevents that.Still trying to get ACER to spit the BIOS backdoor/master password to unlock all features but no success so far.** 08/22/2017 More updates. **With the help from ACER predator forums I learned I could update from the 2x128Gb RAID-0 to a single 512Gb NVMe M.2 stick by removing both SSD's and placing the new one then restore a full backup upon the new drive so as not lose any existing data. (No need to make changes to BIOS except boot order)The process took 2 or 3 tries before getting it right but it worked, with the single NVMe drive the predator is not just fast.It flies!Loading time from Power-Up to Windows 10 login is 7 seconds flat.Afterwards I connected one of the remaining 128Gb sticks to the M.2 SATA connector and using Inter Rapid Storage GUI inside windows broke its RAID setting so I can use it instead to install programs on it.So now I have 3 drives:1x512Gb NVMe M.2 SSD stick.1x128Gb SATA M.2 SSD stick1x1Tb SATA 7200 HD."	4	7	5	8	0
"It's hard to get excited about this machine because it's built to meet very basic expectations at a very low price point. I don't know how it compares to laptops selling at the same price or less but I for one am astounded at how much value there is at the price.The top of the laptop is black textured plastic. It's textured kind of like a fabric weave and looks like it will resist scratches, probably better than metal tops do. Overall it is surprisingly light and thin. It has molded raised feet on the bottom that are about 1/8"" thick. Without those it would be even thinner but they probably help with cooling.I could complain about the limited memory and processor speed but I won't because this thing is faster and has almost as much memory as a laptop I used until 2011 which I paid over $1000 for. Considering how cheap plug-in memory is these days (and getting cheaper) it's easy to spend between $20 and $100 and get additional memory from a 32gb usb up to a 1000gb external usb drive.Even though external memory is cheap, this laptop won't win any races rendering video and probably won't run a lot of games at a satisfactory speed. If all you need to do is poke around on the internet, word processing and basic photo editing type things however it is very adequate. It also comes with Windows 10 for the price of some laptops which run free operating systems. I've been using Windows 10 for over a year now and find it mostly trouble free and intuitive.The keyboard and mousepad are unimpressive but serviceable.While I do think this is a great value, you could easily spend a little more and get a laptop that looks and feels nicer and has more onboard memory."	2	0	0	1	2
This is exactly what I was looking for. It's lightweight, compact. I opened the box, turned it on and within minutes I was logged in (using my wifi password and google account log in). It's basic. But it serves my needs perfectly (web browsing and google drive are all I need). There isn't a caps lock button, so it's going to take some time for me to get used to pressing alt and search. I'm hoping there is a shortcut to this. (I just got it last night). Highly recommend if you are looking for a, as my husband called it, a 'phone w a larger screen and a keyboard'. Again, perfect for my needs.Edit / I discovered that you can make the search key a short cut for other options. I selected mine to be caps lock and now I love this Chromebook even more.	0	0	0	0	4
Features that wow:Price vs value equation due to discrete Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processorUpgraded i7 Kaby Lake with less heat, lower power consumptionFast boot with 128 G SSD hard driveGood screen with low light leakageRed backlit full size keyboard with number padUnderstated styling (low bling), but enough to be happyBright TN screenRelatively solid build, soft touch plasticsLow fan noise even under loadRelatively low weight at 5 lbsFeatures that are less impressive:Plastic everywhereSound is averageDell is not known for making its own Dell branded computer gaming powerhouses—for that you have to jump up in price and bling to Alienware. With Dell’s dedicated Alienware brand you get lots of bells and whistles, including molded style metal cases, very solid builds, full lighting controls, generally nice specs and higher prices. Why change near mid cost perfection with the same case and essentially same innards as the prior i7559 build? This current computer is almost the same with the better Kaby Lake chip set and mostly the same Nvidia GTX1050 (vs GTX 960m). Styling wise the Inspiron is not Alienware, but with some nice red accents on the rear facing under screen grill and a red Dell logo on the lid, the Inspiron distinguishes itself as not your father’s Dell. [Full disclosure, having owned and upgraded from the prior Alienware M11X R3 laptop along with an i7559, I do love Alienware laptops.]First, Kaby Lake intel i7 chipset represents one of the best solutions to lower heat, lower power consumption with higher performance than the prior generation. Same for the Nvidia GTX1050—which performance wise during gaming, produces less heat and uses less power for similar performance (if not slightly higher in actual use!) than the prior equivalent graphics processer GTX960. This means that a gaming laptop can be built without it being a vacuum cleaner or jet engine for heat control at load. The current Kaby Lake i7 chip is highly acceptable and powerful enough to run just about anything you can toss.The 128 G SSD comes loaded with Windows 10 and it is suggested to jump immediately to updates at Microsoft and Dell for the latest drivers. [I moved immediately to W10-Creators and had no issues.] I was hoping that under the rear screw panel there might be room for removal of the 1T disc based 5200 RPM HD for replacement with an SSD, but no such luck. I suppose it could be done but it was not turnkey like a couple of prior iterations of this same laptop case. Startup is quick with the main operating system on the 128G SSD, at less than 30 seconds under normal circumstances. The 1T hard drive operates acceptably with Steam game files and other data in place.So Kaby Lake i7 and Nvidia GTX1050 is a perfect lower cost, lower heat alternative and partner with improvements over prior Skylake – GTX960 combo? Yes it is. No, it is not a GTX1060-70-80, each with progressively faster game frame rates, and higher quality settings during gaming, but most will find the 1050 a good alternative to higher prices. Gamers should and would question if the GTX1050 will play the games they want to play—and the 1050 may have limits depending on the game. For the games I play the most, I can report full functionality with high settings and Physix running on high settings for all the Borderlands series games, Fallout 4, and DOOM on this capable Dell Inspiron. While I cannot report on actual FPS, there is no obvious slowdowns in full action movement for these games. This laptop does like to be plugged in for game play at these levels, which I am used to from prior laptops. If you are not plugged in, you may have some movement and frame rate stutters in more demanding games at higher settings. The Nvidia 1050 provides low heat output at load. This Dell runs quiet with no audible fan noise at normal loads and tasks. When pushed during gaming the fan is audible but is very quiet so you would not necessarily need headphones during game play.The keyboard itself is good with a bit of play and solid feeling but no noticeable flex. Not mechanical but adequate. It is friendly to gaming and touch typing with full size keys and a nice number pad. Red LED lighting can be turned off or dimmed.The 15.6-Inch FHD TN screen has wide viewing angles, is very bright, and good color representation. As an improvement over the prior 7559 version, this sample does not have any border light leakage.Mouse pads are a sore point with many. The use of single surface pads is happening more and more, and often a source of issues. Having a work based ThinkPad, with a mostly unusable integrated pad, I always jump to a dedicated mouse. The Dell Inspiron’s pad is a bit better with mostly positive and separated sections for “right/left” buttons—although the offset may not appeal to all. Of course, if you are buying this laptop for gaming, you are already going to use a dedicated mouse.Sound quality is acceptable with good stereo separation, although the subwoofer is certainly not earthshaking. Strangely enough, out of the box, some diagnostic work was required and drivers had to be reinstalled due to no sound. Admirably, Windows made this simple with a quick restart.So, should you buy this laptop? Personally, for the games I play and the tasks I do, this is a great laptop for the price, albeit not “perfect” . You should consider what games you may play and read additional reviews regarding the suitability of the Nvidia GTX1050 for your own uses prior to jumping to any system that has similar specs. Great value and recommended.	3	9	3	8	0

First, the keyboard is backlit. Press the F5 key and there you go. Honestly, this is a superb laptop, especially for me. It's fairly light weight, very easy to use, more storage than just about any human could use, a lot of great features. I would have loved to own this thing five years ago. There's nothing cheap or flimsy about it. I read other reviews about a noisy fan, but I'm not hearing it and my hearing is very good. Maybe it was a later improvement on the model? I don't know, but this thing is as silent as it gets. Seriously, this is a very nice computer. Yes, there is no DVD drive, but you can buy one to USB attach for less than $40, so that shouldn't be too big of a deal. And, oh yeah, a very good keyboard. Excellent key feel makes typing very comfortable.	2	6	3	8	3

It is fast and I don't think is slow as complain by some reviews, most probably after downloaded the antivirus software.

The E drive also not there, lack of partition but overall this laptop can consider very fast. It great even though not a back-lit keyboard.	3	3	1	8	3

I was surprised at the level of performance. I have had this about a month now. I bought it to replace a 6 year old laptop. I thought any purchase of a new laptop would be a little faster and it actually slower. I use it for emails, social media and checking bank and investment websites. I do have a home surveillance program with four cameras running constantly but I had this on my last laptop too.I cannot seem to view simple YouTube videos. If I do full screen, the video stops completely. All other videos just do that circling signal looking for something. Changing websites takes forever. It just blanks out for a while. It also has delayed responses if I click on a function.I didn't spend a lot which I was pleased with, but maybe I should have spent a little more.My internet speed is very fast.	3	1	0	8	2

"Probably the worst product I've ever purchased in my life. Runs loud and hot at idle, build quality is so bad my 130% dell officemax laptop is sturdier than this, sharp scratchy edges, doesn't even sit flat on a flat surface like a wobbly uneven table, EVERYTHING flexes and bends where you don't want it to, heavy for how flimsy and hollow it feels, keyboard is a gross mushy mess like typing on a plastic bag over a wet blanket, cant put ANY other OS on it, windows 10 makes me wanna vomit my childhood dreams into the nearest trash bin, power button is where the delete button is.....wtf for real its like they took the worst keyboard from the cheapest chromebook they could find and duct taped it in there, computer is UGLY not because of the design choice but because of awkward warped areas in the cheap plastic body, when closed the top back of the screen flexes in ALOT and the circular shine effect looks cheap and uneven, not even very slim for how slow this pc is, I've seen way slimmer and smaller cheap knockoffs from china that ran faster than this dunce, the whole laptop lifts up when you try to open the screen so it required both hands yet the screen wobble is somehow worse than anything I've ever gotten my hands on. Also the whole thing feels very pointless, ""fast"" processor costs a lot of money but its not fast enough to do more than browsing, and looking at media so you might as well get something 500$ cheaper. If you want to know what if feels like to truly get ripped off buy this loose turd."	2	6	5	4	3
everything was as expected, perfect!	3	4	2	8	3
Really it was not what I expected, it is very slow to have a fast processor, the capacity of 2 TB occupy 1 TB and became slower, you could hear a noise like a loose piece inside the equipment, and it turned out to be a loose screw , that left me a lot to be desired, because I understand that in my country Guatemala, I do not have warranty coverage, it is likely that Windows 8 is faster, but Windows 10 is a turtle. I have an Acer I3 two generations earlier and it is much faster	3	6	2	9	3
slowest,most worthless piece of junk I have ever over paid for in my life. Will be smashing it with a sledgehammer tomorrow and replacing with any other laptop except one made by Lenovo.	3	2	1	8	7

Best Laptop for this Money.	4	7	3	8	0
DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!!! They are defective, faulty, and broken. The first one I got kept restarting everytime I turned it on and giving me the blue screen, I just assumed that one in particular was broken so I went and ordered a replacement. The same exact thing happened the same day I got my replacement! This model is faulty, 2 broken laptops sent to me within a week is NOT a coincidence. This was supposed to be a replacement for my broken work laptop, I lost a lot of money and time because of this piece of garbage. Please, save yourself the stress and time and buy a different laptop. I don't want anybody to have to deal with the stress of it like I was forced to. I did everything I could to make it work, but you can't fix a defective product.	3	9	3	8	0
Mine also had the Phantom Touchscreen issue beginning after about 4 months of use. Took it back to Best Buy, they sent it off, it came back in less than two weeks with a replaced screen and no charge because they deal with Samsung So I don't have to. So far so good with the fix.If you are in the US and are having issues, take it to Best Buy. They can help whether you purchased thru them or not.Other than that, it has been a great little machine!	1	1	0	1	4
So far so good. Just know you have to purchase programs like Microsoft like an app vs. download the program.	1	1	0	1	4
"Great computer but my hard disk came defective(it was consuming a lot of the memory with the computer empty and it was making a ""click"" noise and whatever Lenovo was charging me for shipping the product back(around 40 dollars0, for 52, I got a new hard drive and asked my computer technician to change it for meNow it's perfect!!!"	3	2	1	8	7
I have been using this laptop for the past few weeks and have nothing but great things to say about it!! For the past several years, I have been using an iMAC desktop, but there were times I wished I had a laptop, so I wouldn't be tied to my desk.The Dell Inspiron has been great. The laptop is very thin and lightweight. Very sleek looking and easy to throw in a carry all bag or computer sleeve and run out the door. Set up was very easy and took about 20 minutes. Following the prompts made it basically effortless to get up and running. One of the features that is new, is the facial recognition to sign in. User looks into the screen and the computer picks up on features to sign them in. You can also have a backup passcode to enter if your face is not recognized. This is nice if you are the main user but have someone else in the household that would occasionally use the laptop.The battery life has been good. It has been disconnected for about 4-5 hours, laptop was connected to wireless internet and Microsoft running and still the laptop had battery to give before it was plugged back in. The bottom of the computer did get pretty warm on my lap while I was resting it there work on it. I eventually moved the la top to the coffee table because of the heat. Once connected back to the power source, the battery charges very quickly. It was back up to 100% power in no time. That is great if your run your battery low and don't have time to sit and wait for a recharge.Some of the features that took some time to get a hang of, but I ended up loving, were the touchpad and the touchscreen. The touchpad is very sensitive. While typing if you hover close enough to the touch pad it will move the mouse and change your screen. For the first few days that was very frustrating, but once I figured out how to adjust my hands to stay off the pad, it has not happened very much, if at all. The sensitive touch pad is actually something I like now that that I have learned how to control and navigate with it. I can quickly jump from screen to screen or to text within a document.The other new addition to the laptop that I have not had previously is the touchscreen option. That is great!! Having the ability to move around on the screen by touching the actual screen is outstanding. You can use the touchscreen feature while in laptop mode or flip the screen over and have in tablet mode. It takes virtually 1 second to transition the laptop to a tablet.For having a laptop that is for personal use, mostly email, online, and Microsoft office this laptop is perfect. It is fast, lightweight and easy to use. There are so many features that we haven't even touched on yet but I can't imagine that I won't also like those once I get to needing them. I am by no means a computer person or guru but I have been working on a computer for many years and this is by far one of the best laptops I have used!!Very happy with this product and recommend it highly.	2	7	3	3	3
This is a fine laptop for simple tasks.such as writing a blog. But it does not have enough RAM for serious programming work.	2	0	0	1	2
This laptop works okay. What is NOT OKAY is the message from HP telling me that the factory warranty expired three days after I received it. This was not disclosed in the Amazon description and I feel totally ripped off. Brand new computer, no warranty. Any/all stickers have been removed from the bottom of the laptop, so the only place I have a serial number is on the box it came in.. I feel the seller was deceptive in not disclosing this little factoid. HP wants $110 to extend the warranty.	4	6	1	8	3

I upgraded from an older Acer tablet/laptop hybrid (Aspire model). It was good but I needed something more powerful and with better battery, etc. This Samsung Chromebook is just what I was looking for. I do pretty much all my work in the cloud - so running MS Windows-based programs is not necessary for me on mobile. I do have a PC with MS Windows that I still use for certain applications.PROS:1. Display quality is amazing. I'm sure this is because it's a nice upgrade for me but - unless on the beach in the sun - not sure the highest brightness level will ever be necessary.2. It just works - well. Speedy, efficient and quite simple.3. Light and durable in construction.4. The included stylus is a great added feature. The handwriting in Evernote/similar seems to work very well.CONS:1. Keyboard keys are a little tight (very minor complaint).2. As I saw others mention, the trackpad isn't fantastic but it seems to work well.Overall a great buy in my opinion!	1	1	0	1	4
Amazing laptop at a great price!	2	5	2	3	4
"At a ""black friday"" price, this computers specs could not be beat for the value to dollar performance ratio. The only downside of this computer is its battery life which is reasonable at 3 hours and to be expected with a laptop with these specifications. Runs First person shooters relatively well. Have only tested older games so far like Medal of Honor allied assault but also tested modern warfare 4 and it performed spectacularly. The fans did not turn on loudly if at all."	3	1	2	8	6
So far i've enjoyed this laptop,ever since alienware sold their soul to dell,i've used majority of MSI products.I've use their motherboard to build my own desktop,and decided i needed laptop for school(i do use it for school purposes......occasionally hahaha).The keyboard lights is something i've always liked due to the fact i stay up late playing games or doing work,haven't tested the camera yet so i'm unable to give my opinion about it.Video card seems pretty awesome for it's 4g size,i've had no issues playing games like final fantasy 14,league of legends,total war:warhammer 2.The graphics are flawless.Love the anti-glare screen,freaking magical cause it's always been a issue of mine when playing during the day.The laptop case is neat,just notice don't touch any oily or greasey cause it'll leave marks but they are easily wiped away.The cooling fans work perfectly,laptop never really gets too hot unless i'm balls to the walls gaming,notice it does get kinda loud but it's expect when you're trying to keep something like this cool.Something that caught me by surprise was lack of cd-rom slot,now this is my first time owning a ultra light notebook so i guess that's a standard thing since the industary is going away with cds and moving to downloads/cloudservers.dragon center is a really cool app to keep track of the usage and temp of the laptop,but all around i believe this is worth the price i paid.	3	7	2	8	0

Nice little laptop for the price, decent for browsing the internet. Unfortunately my needs do not lend themselves well to it. This was my first small screen, and it's just not enough real estate for me.I also just can not deal with the touch pad mouse. It does a terrible job while using 2 fingers. It's got some good thoughts, just poor delivery.This would be a great notebook for a casual web user.	2	0	0	1	5
DOWNLOAD LINUX. Here's the deal, bought this for gf at xmas for school..at first it worked ok.. THEN the updates were released, the hardware/storage couldn't handle Etc.. it was rendered worthess..sad gf.. I installed Ubuntu linux for 100% free and ERASED windows. Runs GREAT!!! I have used it with multiple linux distros, all worked awesome. My preference is PARROT LINUX HOME. Beginners will like Mint or Ubuntu..btw Microsoft office equivalent comes free on linux.. Libre OfficeI never write reviews but took the time because I genuinely feel bad for the owners who dont know. Really, the laptop runs ubuntu linux excellent for most every day users, for the price, you will agree. Otherwise, its headed to the garbage... just back up your stuff and switch..dont be afraid to make the switch, linux is very easy to use and FAR better than mac or windows. Plus, you can run WINE for free, it enables windows apps on linux.. no brainer.Just type the words MINT LINUX into GoogleYou will be so happy! Greatly improved speed, picture clarity, wifi and battery is soooo much better.With windows 0 stars. With linux 5 stars!!PARENTS, check out linux for kids. FREEWant quicken and other book keeping apps for FREE? Check out GNU CASH, works awesome.Nerdy? Grab an RTL-SDR for $15 and listen to shortwave radio, satellite weather images, radio astronomyWe enjoy using the hdmi port to each hd movies on our TV.Laptop is seriously powerful now.Note to parents, gamers may be still be disappointed.. $100 laptop just isn't gonna make the cut graphics wise...tell them to read a book instead.	0	9	0	1	4

I like this laptop. This is the third Lenovo computer that I have purchased. The laptop is light weight and the keypad feels good. One note though, I could not run Bitdefender because the laptop did not have enough Ghz. It does come with 30 days of McAfee.Another note: the touch pad does not have a scrolling feature. You can set it to scroll using two fingers on the touch pad. This takes some time to get used to. Despite the lack of these features, I still like the laptop.	3	0	0	8	2
At first sight is pretty! but I dont know why the mouse and screen paralized like for 6 seconds and then suddenly starts working again, IT IS STARTING TO WORRY ME,,, when Im watching youtube videos, it paralyzes and I have to close the page... makes me really mad, please... what can I do? I didnt download anything, the first time I turned on it happened!!!!! HELP	2	6	3	8	3
Laptop came with a myriad of issues.TrackPad felt and looked loose. An absurd amount of pressure was needed for the left click to register.Overall performance was lacking especially for a machine with these specs (start up time >4 minutes, opening browser > 30 seconds, opening Word >1 minute, YouTube videos buffered forever even on multiple reliable WiFi connections).After troubleshooting, the following issues were found:1. When running Lenovo Vantage Health & Support hardware scan, the laptop would freeze, restart itself without warning and show the blue screen of death with the following error message: DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE2.Started the laptop in safe mode, uninstalled and corrected the faulty drivers (Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 Wireless Network Adapter, Generic PnP monitor, System Interface Foundation Device) yet the issues still lingered.3. Windows updates would not install. Running the Windows Reapir Tool did not resolve the issue. PC reset did not fix it as well.Pretty freaking annoying; not what I expected at all.	3	2	1	8	7
My space bar doesnt work very well have to press a few timesto get it to work also my right clock button on touch pad doesnt not work at all since i recieved my labtop.	3	1	0	0	2
This laptop has many excellent features. It is super light so you won’t get shoulder strain if you want to carry it around all day in a laptop bag. The laptop just looks nice, from the backlit keyboard to the clear bright screen. It starts up quickly. The specs are impressive and It has performed great so far with internet use, photo editing, word processing, and some Steam gaming. I don’t think this would be the best system for a hardcore gaming machine, but it’s great for games that are not extremely system demanding. It has a good size hard drive which is a definite plus. Overall, an nice machine that should perform well for someone needing to do typical home computer work and light gaming.	3	7	2	8	4

The biggest problem I have with this computer is that it will shut off at random times for no apparent reason. It is not overheating and it can happen whether using 5 windows or none. No rhyme or reason. The other thing that is annoying is that this computer boasts its graphics capability, but bogs down with simple video editing. This was a large reason for my purchase of this computer.It is hard to see a plus with this computer with the intermittent power issues. I have read that others experience the same now and there is little resolution available. I guess I can say that it is working for the time it takes to write this review.	3	6	3	3	0
This really is an excellent product from Microsoft, proud owner of this machine since August 2017, never lets me down, incredible battery lifetime, totally silent and really thin! I've owned loads of laptops and this one tops them all. I also own the latest Microsoft Surface Pro (not the laptop) because I couldn't decide between these beasts. I really like them both, a really good hardware and overall goods products by Microsoft. They hit the sweet spot with these machines. Highly recommended!	2	7	2	3	3
Really marginal customer service. The computer comes loaded with windows 10. There seems to be a problem with windows indexing so I am getting marginal results when searching through my emails. The indexing function is not working in the control panel and when I called Lenovo they told me its not their problem its windows even though they were the ones who included it with the computer. They wanted to charge me $69 dollars to fix the problem.The other thing is the web cam picture is very poor quality. I wouldn't recommend this lap top.	3	2	1	8	7
Absolutely LOVE my chromebook! I went from having Windows laptops my whole life, so I was a bit nervous to try a Chromebook. It has been the best decision I have made.

This computer is very comparable to the MacBook. There are a few features that we saw as it's best.-Very light and slim, makes for easy carry.-Speakers- They work very well, especially compared to the MacBook's quiet speakers.-Touch Screen is very easy to work and manage.-The key board has a nice surface and makes it easy for typing and resting hands on.-The charger cord doesn't seem to cause any fraying at the computer connection.-At this point, it runs up fast and smooth.-The APP options makes it super easy to jump to your favorite show, check email and other items.The negatives of this computer are the following:-There are no Hard/Protecting Cases made for it yet, which could be a problem especially for my household size.-The charging cord is pretty short. (I did not review to see if a longer size was available.)-The battery seems to be a good battery, however when the computer is not on battery save mode, it tends to die quick.-While on Battery save mode, the screen seems to be darker than what would be requested of our norm. (This could be a personal preference.)Overall, I highly recommend this computer. We are a MAC family and tend to steer away from other products. This computer again seems to be the closest Microsoft computer that we have touched that can compete with MacBook. We will be curious to see how long it's life lasts.	2	7	2	3	3

As reviewed: i5-8520U, 8GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB FireCuda Hybrid DriveI am very happy with this little laptop. Now I'm a person who can't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens. I'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 21:9 monitors and regularly use both when I'm doing homework. I'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user. I needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so I started looking for a small laptop with decent specs. For me this laptop matched everything I needed at a reasonable price.The main selling points for me were:-Small portable size-1080p ips screen-Decent cpu-Traditional layout-Subjectively a nice lookOnce I got my hands on it I had some thoughts on it. I was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic. When I first started using it I wasn't sure I'd like the track pad, but in use I haven't noticed it at all, it's functioned exactly how I want it to. I consider the keyboard to be good, I'd prefer a more clicky experience but I can't fault anything about it. I feel fast and accurate typing on it. I installed Linux Mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking. The only feature that doesn't work on Mint is the fingerprint scanner. The hybrid drive is tolerable, not as quick as an SSD but I'm not bothered by it. The speakers have a decent sound for a laptop, albeit a higher max volume would be nice.In conclusion this laptop offered everything I wanted at a reasonable price. The functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks. If you're looking for a traditional laptop in this size I feel comfortable recommending it. I plan on updating this review if anything happens as time goes on to change my opinion of it.	3	7	2	8	4
In my experience the 2 - 1 laptop meant that it detaches like a tablet, but this new version from ASUS really makes the 2 in 1 laptop experience a lot better. It does not detach like older models but rather stays together and flips 360 degrees due to its all metal hinge. The touchscreen acts like a tablet when you flip it all the way around or if you are browsing web pages you can simply swip up and down. There is no stylus but i dont mind. The screen is very bright and the touchscreen is really fast and responsive. The hard drive has plenty of room and the RAM handles everything I need to do. I am very happy with the keyboard too it feels really nice. The build quality is also good to. It feels like a much more expensive laptop than the price suggests. I get compliments from everyone who sees me use it, even at the airport. Ive never had a stranger ask me what laptop I am using till this one. I highly suggest you give this a try you will love it like I love it. Great laptop.	2	9	0	2	4
This laptop may not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive computers do, but it gets the job done at a more reasonable price. It is very quiet while operating and is super lightweight and portable. Meets all the basic needs of a student.	2	5	2	3	4

Everything you would want in a laptop-lightweight-GREAT screen in my opinion (laptops have trouble having good screens)-long lasting battery charge-charges fast-SUPERB KEYBOARD....-Trackpad is just fine for me, others complain but I haven't had a problem. If anything it's great.-wide viewing angle FHD-Thin-Finger print reader-Good SSD (Nothing crazy but just good enough)-I can run SFV / RCT3 (Street Fighter V, 720p/low settings / Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, 1080p nearly maxed settings) both at 60fps+ with the right settings. (Gaming)-great resolution screen, super clear once you set everything up-No real junkware on here, everything like ASUS Hello (gives free dropbox 12 month for 30gbs), sets up your warranty / acc. to ASUS Splendid (screen), that Vivid option is great.-Super good for price (Performance to price ratio)-Has auto brightness, but I turned my option off but it has a sensor for darkness / brightness of the screen-Dual mic for better qualitySometimes I even turn *down* the screen because it's too bright at times. Currently my screen writing this review is on 33%.neutral:-power button is near backspace. I have no problem with it.. I'm too muscle memory to press random buttons but I can see how beginners / non-tech savy / or butterfingers can press it by accidentcon:-Bad webcam. If you need a webcam, buy an external and still get the laptop!! Gladly, I don't use a webcam.Hit me up under this thread if you want to know something specific.	2	5	2	3	4
I got this laptop for my online college and it works great. The mousepad allows for all functions (like right-click w 2-fingers or clicking the lower right button, it allows for double-tap, 1-click or left-button to select). I like the big screeb and the ability to flip it into tablet mode. The pen is really nice when I'm ready to take a break and do some adult coloring. And it's super light weight. I'm loving it! This is a great machine for the price... But if you are looking for something to do gaming or heavy-lifting dont expect this to do the trick.	2	9	0	2	2

It's very nice looking computer. The screen is sharp and the back lit keys are nice. It came with allot of bloatware. It periodically freezes upand sometimes loads slow. I never know when this is going to happen.. It's really a problem when I have to write an email report for my work and it does this. If I can't send a simple email when I need to, what good is it. I don't think I can send this back. I'm just sick about it. My advise is, buy a Dell.	2	6	3	8	3
"TINY speakers with very poor volume - You can barely have a zoom call without headphones. Printing is a nightmare if your printer is not google chrome compatible. You can not save photo files from the web as .jpgs. Since it has no regular USD you need adaptors for every hard drive or external connection. The guy at best buy said ""A chrombook is not a computer, it is a glorified web browser"" and the longer I used it, the more I found that to be true. I would never ever buy a chromebook again, its just way too limited in what it can do."	1	1	0	1	4
"We bought this to replace our 5 year old Dell that was starting to have connection issues. We really only needed a ""family"" computer to surf the internet and transfer pictures from our cameras/phones onto an external hard drive. For this purpose, the computer works great. It's fast enough with the 4GB of RAM to transfer the photos & videos via USB 3.0 without taking a lot of time. It's small enough that we just keep it on our kitchen counter so we can have access to it whenever we want. I also like that it has bluetooth pre-installed, that way we can use a bluetooth mouse without needing to use one of the USB ports for a wireless dongle. It leaves one of the USB ports free for a flash drive. The only thing I wish it did have was a full size SD card reader. It comes with a micro SD card reader, but our DSLR cameras have full size SD Cards, so we need to buy new micro SD cards with an adapter for our cameras, or a USB / SD Card adapter for the computer. We chose the second route since the adapter is cheaper than buying new micro SD cards. It's not a big deal, but I took off one star for it."	2	0	0	1	5
Want more USB ports? Want to use USB-A? Ethernet? Want to use an external monitor, keyboard and mouse? Good luck!I've tried four separate USB hubs from different manufacturers (j5, Insignia, Apple and Amazon Basics) and none work on the CBP, despite working on other computers.Switching Chrome OS to the beta channel did not improve the situation.This is a complete and total deal-breaker, and to be quite frank, Samsung really ought to be incredibly embarrassed. I cannot believe Samsung would actually release a product that lacks support for multiple common USB hubs, on a machine that has only two USB-C ports.	1	1	0	1	4

"I was disappointed by the quality of the product almost immediately. While I did expect the minor physical defects described and found them to be more minor than anticipated, I did not expect an issue that would impact the use of the product.My particular Chromebook had an issue that caused the cursor to move, disappear, or completely freeze after the screen was adjusted. I suspect a pinched cable in the hinge is the issue.That being said, I enjoyed what little productivity I did get out of the Chromebook; I will return the warehouse ""deal"" for a brand new one and give Samsung the benefit of the doubt."	1	1	0	1	4

Bang for your buck, it's a great little basic computer. Was never a big AMD processor fan in comparison to Intel, but this A9 is decent.Have to admit my son uses it for gaming and SIMPLE animation, but for mild tasking it's been solid.	3	7	3	8	6
I really love this laptop so far. I have bad luck w/ technology so figures cross. But so far. No problem. I did upgrade to the Windows 10 instead of leaving it for 10s, which gave me more options to utilize. I recommend doing that! This laptop is smooth and fast!	2	8	2	3	3
"This laptop worked great at first but slowly degraded over time. If you close the screen, there is no clearance between the screen and the keyboard; this creates marks on the screen that cannot be removed. The computer is also prone to randomly shutting down which makes it heavily inconvenient for nearly any prolonged use; at first I thought it was related to overheating when I gamed on it, but even using Chrome has caused the computer to shutdown after a few minutes of use. The computer also has issues with running multiple programs at once and will freeze, which is unexpected since it's a quad-core. Of course, this all started happening after I installed new drivers for all the components though the device manager, so perhaps it's an unfair judgement that might just be an issue with a bad driver installation.Update: Installed latest drivers, installed latest bios, installed Windows 10 again. Keep getting ""thread stuck in driver"". Various people have issues with this laptop and Lenovo blamed the operating system and refused to service it in warranty unless I proved it was the hardware, but I am not a computer technician. Hardware is failing, warranty is already nearly out of date when computer arrives leaving no time to return Lenovo for repairs. Do not buy."	3	9	2	8	6

"Had the Samsung Chromebook plus for about a month now. Build is good, and battery life excellent, the screen is stunning. Fast processing.Getting used to the Chromebook experience, not many google play store apps stylus apps I used on my 8"" tablet -e.g. Stylus Beta and other writing apps are functioning. Have not really found the styles as useful as I did on the 8"" tablet. Hope this will improve."	1	1	0	1	4

"This is a pretty good laptop and does have all the specs described in the product listing. However, the problem is that the listing is intentionally vague when it comes to giving out the laptop's model number.The listing says, ""Item Model Number: HP PAVILION 15.6 TOUCH I5"", however as anyone knows who bothered to Google the term, this is not a real model number.This laptop's model number is actually 15-bs095ms and I encourage everyone to search Amazon and Google before buying. That way you can be sure you're getting the best prices. Right now (1/25/2018) there are other Amazon listings for this same laptop which are cheaper."	3	6	2	9	3

Had bought the 15 inch Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM, the wifi only connected to some routers, so I just returned it. Tech support and tech forums were not able to fix it.So I decided to buy this computer. Again, wifi only connects to some routers, then a few days after receiving, the touchpad completely dies and tech support suggests sending it in as none of their suggestions worked. On top of this, the laptop would sometimes freeze up completely even when nothing was open and very little ram/cpu/memory was being used, forcing me to hard-restart it. I ended up having to buy a cheap external wifi (which connects to all routers, this means the wifi card in these laptops is faulty), a usb to update windows 10 since it lacks any reasonable memory, and now since the touchpad died, I'll have to buy a mouse. I'm returning this and NEVER buying Acer again.Garbage laptops, stay away.	2	0	0	1	2
Bought this machine for my son. He likes it. No problems so far. I'm not computer savey, so I don't know all the ins and outs about the speed, etc., but he has not complained about any problems	3	6	3	8	3
This is a great device for the price, but not without flaws.I still give it a 5 star review because, as with many of the video reviews out there, I've found it to be a really useful 2-in-1 to have around for games, taking notes, web operations etc. I make much more use out of the built-in pen than I thought I would, and the screen is simply superb.There is, however one oversight with their build of chromeos that will be insignificant to 90% of users, but a showstopper for the few people who want to plug in external MIDI devices for music production.PROS:Display : almost unusable for text at its native resolution, the display has a very wide viewing angle, good black levels ( to my eye ) and is very bright.Stylus pen : really handy, especially at hi-resolutions. Art programs are fun2-in-1 : At less than 2.5lb, feasible to use in tablet mode. Tent, vertical and other modes are handy.keyboard : decent travel, small backspace button, but you get used to that pretty quicklyAndroid on-board : some issues with some applications, but overall a good experience.Snappy performance: Not driven this too hard but performs well for regular use.CONS:- speakers are pretty meh, but I guess that's to be expected; I don't use it to listen to anything- Bluetooth connectivity seems iffy .. they might have not implemented everything perfectly- USB MIDI Does Not Work, period. I've spent a lot of email and phone time with them to convince them to check this out, but Chromeos does support MIDI over USB and the samsung engineers dropped the ball on this one. I've verified MIDI initializes and works on other chromeOS devices, but this one looks like it's missing the drivers or they simply didn't build in the midi libraries. MIDI fails to get past initialization on this device. I escalated the issue as far as I could and eventually convinced the support person to try to get the bug in front of an engineer, but we'll have to wait and see if they fix it. If they do, and make the 14 of us who actually want to use it for midi happy , I'll update this review.OK UPDATE ( 5/17/17 ) : still no fix for midi; samsung cs dropped the ticket, as far as I can tell. Still love the chromebook for other tasks, but I'm dropping a star cos they didn't build the os to spec... and I'm in a petty mood.	1	1	0	1	4

Bought the laptop around November last year as my old laptop died (RIP to my number one solider). Ive always been a fan of MSI but never actually owned any of their products. 7 months in to owning it and it has proven to be such a reliable laptop for every game i play ( league of legends, CSGO, PUBG, Fortnite, Fifa 18, Hunt: Showdown etc.).Id highly recommend this laptop if you are looking for a laptop that can hold up to most games without giving you issues.	3	7	2	8	0

"The netbook style laptop is near perfect! The screen size, feel of the keyboard, light weight and construction is excellent. It has two USB ports, and mini HDMI out and a micro sd card slot. It gives the illusion that it's alluminum, but it's plastic with a nice finish.Just a couple of small things that I can overlook, but are noticeable. First the touch pad doesn't have separate left and right buttons, it's all one pad. I typically leave my finger on the left click button and use my middle finger to move the mouse around. I found that when I operate it like that, it accesses a ""pinch"" feature and zooms in and out. The other thing that stood out to me is because it's so slim it makes it difficult to open.Overlooking those 2 small quirks, I love this laptop!"	2	0	0	1	5

Bought this for my brother who just started college (2017), this is a good alternative to an expensive gaming or two in one laptop. It does run slow at first with updates and bloatware but once removed this is a very good deal for the amount of storage, ram etc. if you’re looking for something for gaming or anything to do with media I would suggest something else, but if you need something for writing, excel and simple computing tasks this is a great option	3	9	3	9	3
At first, everything worked well. I upgraded to regular Windows 10 so that I can install software unlike previous Windows version. Everything worked great for 3 months. The only issue I had was the face recognition sign in, which seemed to only work about a fifth of the time. It's also a pity that the monitor wasn't 360 degrees too. However, overall I really liked the laptop. It was nice and light, and could fit in my purse really well. However, after 3 months, it just stopped working without any reason. There was no physical damage to the laptop whatsoever, I simply closed it like normal one night, and it wouldn't boot up 2 hours later. Monitor went black, and only the keyboard would light up. So while it was working, it worked great despite the iffy face recognition sign in. The touch screen was sensitive enough, and it woke up from sleep reasonably well timed. I've contacted Microsoft support and thankfully there is a 1 year warrante, however, it means they will simply just probably replace it with refurbished one. It's a bit saddening that it only lasted 3 months or so and that now anything on it will be wiped. Hopefully, the next laptop will be longer lasting. Overall, in working shape, it was relatively a 4 star. My only complaints were the face sign in, it wasn't 360 degrees bendable, and the magnetic charging chord often would fall out.	2	8	2	3	3
So disappointed! Right out of the package I loved the color and light weight, quickly hooked it up to charge and began to set it up. Unfortunately it does not connect to Wi-Fi, I tried troubleshooting and even took it to my school's IT department to get it checked out. They installed the latest drivers and still, it won't even recognize any wifi networks available. I am only left to assume it doesn't have a wireless card, or came with a defective one. I am so upset and returning immediately for my money back. I didn't want to believe all the negative reviews, but I don't want to risk getting another dud (which seems to happen very often with this product), furthermore, I needed this to work right out of the box the first time, as I am leaving the country in the next few weeks and can't wait around to be shipped a replacement that may not even work either.	2	0	0	1	5
"I bought this to replace a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit. This Acer is much bigger with its 15.6"" screen. Right out of the box, as usual the setup was almost instant, and I love the feel of the keyboard. I saw a sticker saying to open from both ends to find cord, and it is hard to notice when you're excited to get the chromebook out of its packing. Don't throw the cord away! It was packed very well.So far I love it, and will update if I find it isn't what I thought, but I bought it for the price, size, and the fact that it was a Chromebook. Very impressed with the quality so far!"	3	1	0	0	2
The color is NOTHING like in the picture. In some lightings it is a faint rose gold, in others almost just silver. Still, it is very light and the keyboard is a comfortable size. Even though it does not appear as it does in the picture, and I cannot figure out how one would go about replacing the battery, I have become very fond of this little notebook and would definitely say it is worth the price.	2	0	0	1	5

I have used this computer for 3 months. I can only recommend this computer to someone that is skilled at computer repair!!!Pros:It plays games like PUBG, witcher 3 and Watch Dogs 2 with high/ultra settings at the screens refresh rate, which is 75Hz.Plenty of storage if you don't mind a little longer load times from the 7200 RPM hdd. Also storage is easily expanded.Not that hard to replace/upgrade ram.Opening up the computer is not complicated and I didn't see a single warranty void sticker.The battery times are better then advertised. With light use it has lasted ~4 hours to 20% remaining.BUT! It had several issues from the factory,Cons:It would freeze randomly! Total lock up that needed the power button held down to turn off. This went away only after I installed the latest version of the BIOS. This is not something to be taken lightly as you can brick the computer during this process if not careful.It is now stable with no crashes or other errors.The speakers create a noticeable rattle/buzz at certain frequency's. Its somewhere under the keyboard. I try not to use them much because of this. Not the biggest deal for me.It gets really hot. The factory thermal paste is not good. Too much and poor quality, as everyone knows. This is an ongoing issue for this computer. I have re-pasted the CPU and GPU with ARCTIC MX-4. Before I was getting up to 97c with heavy gaming quite quickly. Within ~30 mins. Now I still get up to 97c but much more slowly, about 4 hours. And with most games it only gets to about 83c. I plan on re-pasting again with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.I also have the CPU under volted by .120 volts. I don't know if this is helping but there is no performance loss.It has a lower tier Windows 10.It serves my needs quite well but if I wasn't able to fix it it would have gone back within the first day.	4	7	5	8	0

We purchased 3 of these for our company and couldn't be happier. We have a web based training program for some of our employees and these fit the bill perfectly.

After installing all of the updates and semi-configuring the laptop. I have an issue. The touchpad is terrible. It decides when it wants to allow you to right click or click anything. I don't always want to touch my screen to start an action. This is the WORST touchpad I've ever used on a laptop and I work in IT. My Huawei Matebook X touchpad responds when I decide to use it which is every time I'm using the computer. Changing the sensitivity doesn't help. I should never have to click on the touchpad more than once to bring up the right dialog menu or to launch a program. This is a disaster. I'm returning it.	2	7	2	3	3
The computer is slow and cannot handle many tabs open. I also find the battery does not anywhere near the advertised level.	2	0	0	1	5
Unfortunately, it seems this laptop suffers from the typical Asus/Amazon quality control issues.The unit I received is clearly defective. Fist thing I noticed: there is some pretty bad blacklight bleed on the screen. The processor also makes a very loud and unsettling electrical sizzling noise. It can be heard all the way across my living room when the computer is just idling on the desktop. It gets even louder the more you stress the processor, and it's a very high pitched whine. If you have high frequency hearing loss you may not even hear it, but for me its unbearable.I have monitored the temps on the CPU while doing various tasks with the computer. Doing anything more than web browsing makes the temps jump above 70C, and the fan is constantly whining.I kept testing out the laptop to try and figure out what was up, and in the process I got several BSODs, and the battery strangely went from 74% to 0% while the laptop was just sitting on my desk for a couple of hours.Something is definitely wrong with the power delivery system, or the CPU. I have requested a replacement, but have not yet heard anything back fro Amazon. I really hope I am not stuck with a defective machine.I really want to love this machine. The specs, design and build quality are exceptional. I am truly hoping that I can get a working replacement and can update my review.	2	6	5	4	3

Excellent Thermals, Excellent Graphics, performed on par with my Alienware R15 1070 but actually ran cooler. Only con is that it requires constant power to actually play games at decent framerates, which is understandable considering the 1060 is almost on par with the desktop variant but it defeats the purpose of a portable gaming laptop. Sleek design does collect finger prints rather easily, and they’re very hard to get rid of. Screen looks great with deep blacks and good colors. Either backlight bleeding or ips glow is a minor issue with this laptop but still annoying to the average perfectionist. And a touch sensor is a very nice addition. If you’re sold on a gaming laptop this is the best one for the price in my opinion.	3	7	2	8	0

"Not the best computer, not even close to the best. It's big. 17"" screen w/ a dvd drive and it weighs over 7 pounds. It is NOT a laptop it's more of a portable desktop. You cannot read the keys from any angle because they are the same color as the case so they blend in so well that you have to be directly over the keys to read them. And did I say it is slow. It takes 2-4 minutes to boot, and that's after I removed some of the bloat ware (skype and the anti-virus). There are no visible ready lights, so you don't know at any point of time what's going on or even if the computer is actually on. No owner's manual, not even a cd, so it's hard to get started. Some of the problems may be the operating system, Win 10. Maybe w/ Win 7 it would speed up a bit and be easier to use. As it stands now it is virtually worthless to me and I can't send it back as it was a birthday gift bought in February gifted in March, the day before the return date. Oh well, it might make an OK door stop or boat anchor. Oh yeah, it does have a beautiful screen but that's all I can say nice about this POS."	4	2	0	8	6

I love this computer ! I've never had a gold one or one this small but it doesn't seem TOO small. I can carry it around with 2 fingers, seems to totally charge up in less than 2 hours. I really like the keyboard. I don't know what it is about it that's different than all the others I've ever used - keys are bigger, closer together ? I dunno, but it's very easy to type on this. It's repackaged or refurbished or something but looks brand new :o) ADDENDUM: LOVE THIS COMPUTER, WHEN IT WORKS ! I USED IT TWICE, EVERYTHING WAS FINE. SHUT IT OFF BY JUST CLOSING THE SCREEN. WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON, IT WOULDN'T CONNECT. SAID NO WIFI DEVICES PRESENT ON COMPUTER. I REBOOTED, SCANNED, CLICKED EVERYTHING, REBOOTED MODEM ... FINALLY AFTER 2 HOURS, THE RED X ON THE WIRELESS ADAPTER OR SOMETHING WENT AWAY. WORKED A FEW MORE TIMES. I CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT LOGGING OFF, TRIED TO TURN IT ON AGAIN 2 MINUTES LATER, IT WOULDN'T. THIS TIME I SPENT PROBABLY 3 HOURS CLICKING EVERYTHING I COULD, READ EBOOK ONLINE, NOTHING ... HOPFULLY THE SELLER WILL GIVE ME ALL MY MONEY BACK ! IT WAS THE FIRST ASUS AND FIRST USED COMPUTER I'VE EVER BOUGHT, AND THE LAST !

The computer was a lemon. It was sent back and forth by Dell for weeks on end, never once resolving the issues. The warranty that comes with Amazon purchases is mail-in only, with 12 day wait times each go, and you pay out of pocket for shipping. They simply swapped the hard drive each time because it passed the cut-rate self diagnostic tool that Dell puts on your BIOS as bloatware. This machine was amazing when it ran for the first few weeks. But once it died, it got stuck ina fial to boot cycle, and I got stuck in a fail to fix cycle with Dell Support. Will never buy another Dell again. This was a terribly unreliable product, and the only thing worse is how terrible Dell support was.	3	9	3	8	0

This computer has been such a disappointment. It looks beautiful and is extremely light and portable but it has caused nothing but trouble. Within a year I've had to replace the battery ( with little to no support from Asus despite multiple outreach). Keys regularly stick on the computer. It shuts off randomly and when on sleep mode, will frequently switch itself on and drain the battery over night. I've taken it to multiple people for check up and fixes and other than some serious hardware flaws, no one can quite figure out the problem.I'm quite gentle with my devices. I carry them in cases, I keep them clean and relatively dust free, I update my software including malware protection regularly but for whatever reason, this Asus has continued to be a let down.Not to mention absolutely zero customer service. I will be buying a new computer as soon as I can and not returning to Asus products again.Definitely worth it to just pay $300 more for a macbook air.	2	5	2	3	4
This is a very nice laptop with a full range of features for the selling price. The 7th Gen Intel i5 Core with 2.5Ghz is a quick enough processor for my speed needs.

Five stars for affordability vs features, speed and capacity.	3	9	2	8	3

Was excited to buy. I went to Best Buy to check it out before purchasing. I was disappointed, I expected more.The size is awkward if you plan to watch movies on it. This is 3:2 ratio and movies are widescreen so it just did not feel right. Too bad, because th screen itself looks great.The keyboard is crammed and feels cheap. Not backlit either.Terrible speakers.The body itself is terrible. I expected nice, sturdy aluminum body similar to a macbook. It is like a cheap plastic.The computer was not as responsive as I hoped while I was using it. A spent over an hour using it because I was trying to convince myself to buy it. I just couldn't, it was just not worth it.I ended up going with the Asus C302. It feels more premium and is better in every way (except for the screen resolution).	1	1	0	1	4

Chrome browser in a box. If that is what you need excellent. Think of the most locked up useless tablet you can find. That tablet is more useful then a chromebook or a chromebox. Get a keyboard and monitor for your smart phone and you get a better system. If it can run in or on a chrome web browser then it probably run on a chromebook. If can not run on a chrome browser then it can not run on a chromebook.	3	1	0	0	2

I really wanted to lime this computer. It was super light and I liked the color. The charging cable was long and it had the basics I needed. My problem started when I began using it for school. I used Word on it and it kept updating and restarting. I was planning on returning it before the 30 day period but my mom who isn't computer savvey wanted it. She didn't use it til last month and it wasn't turning on. The laptop won't turn on at all and it's only been 9 months. I don't think there's a warranty but I will check and hopefully get it fixed.	2	0	0	1	5

The product meet my expectations. I use it, basically, to surf the internet and it’s a very fast computer for the price !It has very few signs of having been used. The appearance is 90 - 95% newCons.Charger looks very cheap and its noisyIts an old model so it's heavy, but seems to be strong.Touch pad doesn’t Work - or is not activated (I do not care and do not try to fix it)	2	6	0	7	2

If you are looking at Chromebooks, this is the best for a truely well rounded tablet and Chromebook combo. I choose this one over the Pro because the Plus runs Android apps better. I would love a Pixel book but the price is a joke. I would never spend $1000+ dollars on a Chromebook. For a quality laptop running windows, sporting a Blu-ray reader with more functionality I could justify a grand but not for a simple Chromebook for schoolwork and watching Netflix etc.	1	1	0	1	4

Great choice for my first gaming laptop. Crisp clean resolution and audio and this might be my excitement clouding me but i think my internet even runs faster on it.. Amazing battery life when not gaming (about 6 hours while i was downloading stuff) And while i game with my charger plugged in, even without it the battery life is pleasant. Its fast and powerful for my most played games like PUBG and EFT which are moderatly demanding games. LED lit keyboard makes typing at night effortlessly and the brightness of the computer can be turned down. A great all rounder laptop with more than enough bang for the buck.	3	7	2	8	0

I would look elsewhere for a better price on this particular refurbished HP laptop. Other online vendors have this exact HP laptop refurbished for much less than $183. I should have researched the price before I bought from Amazon. Amazon is not always the cheapest. MSRP is $200. Have not had much time to really get into the performance, but I can say it is really light weight which is a big plus. I would suggest removing HP's bloat ware and other crap installed from 3rd party vendors as this laptop only has 32gb. You can purchase a 64gb USB flush fit flash drive for around $16, well worth the upgrade.	2	0	0	1	5
I bought this for my wife to replace her older, bulky, HP laptop. It was a few years old and replacement was due. She picked this one out at a retail store and we found it on Amazon for a reduced price. She LOVES it!! So light, fast, and cute because it's her favorite color. The palm rests have a cloth feeling but they are made of some plastic stuff that's easily cleaned, the screen looks great, and the keyboard feels right... partly due to the palm rests allowing a person to rest palms on them while typing. It has a fast hard drive, it's quiet and light. I really don't have negatives to say about it except that it only has a couple of USB 3 ports. That's OK... I bought a tiny USB 3 hub and we're all good now. Definitely recommend this device though it's not cheap.	2	7	2	3	3
This was a replacement for another Chromebook so the performance was as expected eg. excellent. What pleasantly surprised me , because I hadn't given it any thought , was that all my sites were there complete with remembered passwords. Chromebooks are the best buy for the buck.	3	1	0	0	2

Great laptop so far. Bought for college and works great. The only drawback is the low memory. Use a low-profile flash drive to make up for that fact. Don't use a micro SD card for long term storage because the SD card is not flush to the side of the computer.	2	0	0	1	2
This thing is for surfing the web and it is good for it. The touch screen and stylus will spoil you. I am not joking about that. When I use my old laptop now I find myself touching the screen.	1	1	0	1	4
Amazing my dream computer	0	0	0	0	4
The higher resolution screen, ability to fold over, and the touch pen made this a far more attractive option for watching videos and browsing the web than a similarly priced tablet. It is not as capable as something like the Microsoft Surface but the Chrome OS is quick and easy to use. The size makes it easy to carry in a backpack or messenger bag and the full keyboard makes typing simple. If you want a device that is primarily for web browsing this is a terrific option.	1	1	0	1	4
Not a powerful device but it serves its purpose. Ideal for a child where you won’t worry as much about them losing or breaking it.	2	9	0	2	2

To give some background, I purchased this laptop for the purpose of video editing as my only other laptop I owned was a 2012 Acer Aspire. Product arrived exactly as described. You could barely tell it was refurbished other than the 2 very minor scratches along the top, at least on the model I received. The only issue I have had with it was the SD reader not working, but I am sure it has something to do with the drivers. Even so, that is what card readers are for. I could not be any happier with my purchase!	1	7	2	3	4
COIL WHINE!!!	2	6	5	4	3
It looks great but i could never finish upgrading the system as soon as I got it. It was the slowest machine I have never had, and my last one was a dell machine I bought on 2008. It took to long to turn on by a 2018 standard. The battery was at 43 percent after fully charged after 1 and 1/5 time of looking it up. Disappointed I returned it right away.	3	6	2	8	3
"I've had a lot of computers, and this might be my favorite. The screen is flawless - bright and high-resolution. The stylus is a little cramped, but very responsive and pressure sensitivity is dead-on (I'm typically using Infinite Painter for drawing, which works great). A little too heavy for use as a true tablet or e-reader, but it's easy to put in ""easel mode"" on my lap to do drawing or play some games. Performance is so-so - definitely keeps up with multiple browser tabs and fairly intensive Android apps, but it's just a little pokey all the time. For a couple hundred dollars more, you can get the Pro version, which ought to be a lot peppier. But I got this as a second computer, and I don't need high performance. Also, if you're dubious about Chromebooks, I can only say that I have run into very few situations where it can't do what I want, thanks to having full access to both the Chrome and Android app stores.Does this have flaws? Absolutely. Keyboard feels nice but is laid out weirdly, build quality is a little haphazard with a decidedly plasticy feel to joints (you will NOT mistake this for a MacBook), but the sum total exceeds the value of the individual parts."	1	1	0	1	4

A 32 GB hard drive is completely consumed by the operating system. Yes, it has Windows 10 and that's all you'll ever have. Also, it cannot apply updates to Windows 10 because there is not enough hard drive space. Get used to an error message about that every time you turn the machine on.Also it claims to come with a year of Office products, but when you receive it there is an insert in the package that says this is no longer true. They are installed, but there is no license.I like it for being lightweight and cute, but can't recommend and wouldn't buy again.	0	9	0	1	4
I just opened it to look at before wrapping it for Christmas gift. It is nothing like the picture. There's this huge opening towards the back. It almost looks as if it were broken. The color is not the same either. It's a lighter blue. I feel like returning it. Not worth it.	2	0	0	1	2
This is replacing my 2012 13 Inch MacBook Pro and its a great upgrade. The core i5 is a perfect performance for what I’m using it for, and I think Anybody could like it. It’s design is really good, and the keyboard is the best I’ve had.	2	8	2	3	3
So I just got this laptop this month, so it's still early on, but so far I love it. I needed a new computer because the screen on my old one was on the fritz, making me not exactly want to use it. It's amazing having a fully functioning laptop again. The setup on this is easy to do, they even walk you right through it. It's really quick (especially compared to my old one) and I'm loving the fingerprint scanner. I realized a few days into using it that it doesn't have a number pad like my old one, but I'm accommodating to get around that- it was mostly the minus key I'm missing so I can quickly add things like em dashes while I'm typing in Word. So far so good. I'm so happy I went with this laptop versus any others I had been looking at. I may be developing a brand loyalty here; my old laptop was Asus, too, and it lasted me quite some time.	3	7	3	8	3
I love the laptop but am seriously annoyed at the cool whine... this meets if not exceeds my expectations but I wish the coil whine issue would be fixed.	2	6	5	4	3
"I think the star rating for this laptop is skewed a bit because the product page is for 3 different models.I bought the ""rose gold"" 4GB 11.6"" model, and so far I've been really pleased.The 4GB of RAM is crucial to getting the most from the processor. No surprise that a majority of the one star reviews on here are for the 2GB model.All hardware works perfectly, all inputs feel very snug and secure. The only port I haven't tried is the mini HDMI.The full size keyboard is a nice touch. The trackpad material is satisfyingly smooth and responsive. Gestures work great. It can lag a tiny bit if the computer gets bogged down but that happens rarely.No flapping or give on the hinge for the screen, and the surface of the plastic doesn't show fingerprints. The build quality and design of this machine is way beyond the price point.The speakers are very meh. They sound nice and clear but the bass response is absent.Now for the screen: I really want to emphasize that the factory settings for the display don't do it justice. Take the time to calibrate it and fine tune the HD graphics settings and you will be able to get a lot more contrast and vibrancy from the screen. Photos and videos looked much better after some adjustment.This laptop is extremely portable, and though it might not be Macbook Air level thin, it is actually lighter. But the light weight does not keep this from feeling like a quality computer. I did a ton of research on similar laptops with more reviews before I went for this one. I'll update this review if I experience problems in the future, but for $200 this was an excellent purchase."	2	0	0	1	5

****UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE****I still really like this laptop, but a few issues have arisen that I wanted to mention. First, the laptop shuts off at 6% battery, not when it gets down to 0%, and then once it shuts off, I have to wait about 2-3 minutes after plugging it in for it to boot up. So that's really annoying, especially if I'm in the middle of something. Also, inexplicably, the brightness keys stopped working. These are not huge issues, but little annoyances on a laptop that's still quite new.*****Original Review Follows****I have been using this laptop for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it. It’s my first Windows laptop in a long time---I’ve been using Macs for quite a while---and this is really fantastic and feels like a big upgrade over my Macbook Pro.There are so many things I love about it, so I’m just going to go through them. The battery life is excellent. It’s very thin and light and sleek; basically it’s visually beautiful. I adore the touchscreen---I thought it was going to be kind of gimmicky but it’s super responsive and a nice feature. The speakers are amazing, and that’s probably where I see the most notable difference between this computer and my Macbook---the speakers and sound is just ridiculously good. Oh, and the facial recognition for login is a neat feature.The ports are decent; I personally find the lack of an HDMI port a little annoying but that might not be an issue for most people. That’s actually the only real negative for me, so if that’s not an issue for you, you might not have any negatives.I have to admit that having used a Mac for so long, I was a little worried about how I would find the Windows OS, but I found it really easy to pick up, and in just a few weeks I feel totally used to it. This computer is fast, responsive, and instinctive.I absolutely love this laptop and have no regrets for giving up my Macbook for it. Love, love, love it.	2	7	2	3	3
There are many reviews out there that will tell you most of the intricacies of owning this computer, but there is a thing or two I did not see mentioned before so I would like to put it out for those few people who may find them important.To start politely, if you are looking for a laptop computer, you should seriously consider this one. It has all the potential you may want. It is just that it has limitations, too.First trivia about it is that the power button is located on the keyboard. It is between other buttons, not bigger and not smaller, just one of the buttons there. It is not even the one in the corner, it is the second one from the right in the top row. You will get used to it, but the choice of the position is unexpected, at least.Much more important to me is the fact that computer is practically barely usable unless you open the Microsoft Store account. It does not work straight from the box in the way computers should. Well, it will work with what comes preinstalled on it, but nothing else. A lot has been written about pros and deficiencies of Windows 10 S so I will skip those details, but you are not going to install anything on them without Microsoft Store account. Every review on every tech site will tell you that it qualifies for FREE upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and then you will be able to install programs the way you are used to with no limitations. Unfortunately, no website mentioned that Windows 10 Pro cannot be installed/upgraded to without Microsoft Store account. In case you thought that paying serious money to get a computer with operating system should be enough, you are out of your naïve luck. You will be able to meaningfully use that same computer only if you join the Microsoft Store club from which you may not have any intention to ever buy anything. Where is the rationale for asking gender and date of birth to open an account for upgrading to the operating system you were promised you would be able to easily upgrade to after you paid for the computer is open to discussion.Aside of that Apple-esque idea, I think the computer may be good for those who have Microsoft Store accounts and do not feel fooled by not being able to upgrade without joining the club. For the rest of us, it is a machine that could, but failed to deliver due to pre-installed software limitations.Please note, reviews of the new computer are not of the feel of the buttons or softness of the Alcantra only. They involve preintalled software and ability to use the item without having to jump through the unadvertised hoops.	2	7	2	3	3
This is my first Gaming Laptop and I must say it is amazing. The design is great and the computer is powerful! I use the computer for work and for MMORPG. Games like Runescape and WoW run flawlessly on Ultra settings. Web surfing is a breeze and the start up of the computer takes only 5-8 seconds.	3	9	3	8	0
This is a great Laptop. The AMD FX is an awesome processor. I ordered 5 of these for our office and they all work great. They fire up fast. They run any application that I've used so far with ease. The only downside to this laptop is the slow WiFi card. It is definitely under powered for this machine. We have 150 Mbps WiFi capabilities in our offices. These laptops can't seem to clear 54 Mbps speeds over WiFi.	3	9	2	8	6

I purchased my laptop about 8 months ago. It has a couple of huge issues. First, every once in a while it will stop responding to any keys. It has to be hard shut down using the pin hole on the bottom. This has happened about 3 times since purchasing the computer. The second issue is that one of the speakers makes a loud static noise when the laptop starts to get warm. It happens really fast when you do any kind of VR or play games. It is too loud to keep playing.Acer Customer Service is worse than these issues. The agents are really hard to understand and Acer will force you to ship your laptop to them, AT YOUR EXPENSE, so they can work on it.I will never buy anything from Acer ever again.	4	7	5	8	0

The computer itself is great but not straight out of the box.This is my 2nd laptop from Lenovo and it had all the same problems as the first one did. CPU running high, HDD staying at 100%. So when I got my 2nd laptop I plugged in my Win10 bootable flashdrive and performed a clean installing of Windows and then I installed all updates, BIOs, and drivers. I then installed my own antivirus software and that immediately fixed my HDD staying maxed out because it was due to Windows Defender. My only dislikes is that it uses Seagate HDD and Samsung memory chip. Every Seagate HDD that I've owned which is a lot has all failed and I hate all Samsung products because all have failed for me in laptops, tv's, and phones. Western Digital HDD is what I like and never had one fail. My other dislike is that I have to remove the complete back panel to gain access to the HDD or memory. I like it better when it has a small quick access panel for this. I only recommend this laptop to Tech's and not the average users due to Windows 10 problems.	3	2	1	8	7

Had this for a couple of weeks and the jury is still out. It has some cool features but there are some things I miss about my Toshiba Chromebook.Pros:- Form factor - it's extremely thin- USB-C - has a USB C on each side for charging/connectivity. The nice thing is you can plug the charger in whichever side is convenient. Of - course no turning the connector over to figure out how it goes in - it's about time!- Android apps - this is the first Chromebook built from the bottom up to run Android apps. Now I can play Words with Friends and run most of my other apps as well.- Converts to tablet - this plus the fact that it runs Android apps makes it very convenient- Stylus - it's cool although I don't use it very often yet.- Bright screen with 4x3 ratio - the 4x3 ratio is actually more useful than the widescreen notebooks. Makes for more usable space.Cons:- No backlit keyboard - really? For a $400 Chromebook one would think this would be a given.- The keyboard - I can't put my finger on it but these keys are hard to get used to. Backspace key is too small and hard to hit (I make a lot of mistakes)- Trackpad - not very responsive. The tap to click doesn't work very well, not near as good as the Toshiba I traded in for this. This is one of the biggest cons to me because I use the trackpad all the time.- Android apps are buggy - Android support on Chromebooks is still in Beta status and it shows. Apps crash or don't display very well. It's the price you pay for being on the bleeding edge.- Speakers in the bottom - not sure what Samsung was thinking. Probably the worst place to put speakers. Volume is just barley adequate and completely inadequate in a loud room.Those are the high points. Overall it's a pretty good Chromebook it wouldn't hurt to have a little more horsepower which the Chromebook Pro should provide.	1	1	0	1	4
I love this computer, And the price is far below all other computers with the same specs. Shipping was fast.I will recommend your company and this computer to anybody that is looking.If all that wasn't enough, it is upgradeable to even higher specs should the need arise.I'm a computer tech, self taught and would do the upgrades myself. Thanks for the great product and price.	1	7	2	3	4
Be very careful, if you need different browsers and extensions, you might, as I have done, rendered this laptop almost useless.Even different anti-virus for web use and local machines might stop you dead.I will start all over again, that's well over 500 hours of wasted time.t's needed.Ray Romero.I thought I'd give this thing one more look see.

I returned it after a couple weeks. The WiFi dropping issue was too annoying. It would randomly lose WiFi connectivity. Restarting the device was the only way to fix it. I looked online and saw so many people complaining about this issue. Even here in the reviews, I saw stories of people going back and forth with customer service about the issue and getting replacement devices. I didn't want to go through all that trouble. It's absurd that, out of the box, it would have such a crippling problem.	1	1	0	1	4

I think my phone has more storage capabilities than this thing, but it does what I want it to do, for the most part. I just needed something cheap simple to keep by the bedside or at the coffee table for guests to use. It boots up fast, but the Windows 10 Upgrades are kind of a nightmare to deal with (Slow, freezes, even said it didn't have enough disk space to update). Love the subtle gold color and that it wasn't a cheap-looking metallic gold. It's very tiny, cute, and light weight. Purchased a 32gb microSD for storage like others suggested, and it was kind of difficult to get in, but it works.	2	0	0	1	5
Though I bought this in November, 2017 I only opened the box yesterday. It took about 7 hours to download everything, but maybe that is normal. I don't really know.

This laptop might be good for younger tech savvy people but for old people like me that just want a laptop to do their work and browse the internet, it is not for them. Everything is completely different about this thing and it is like relearning how to use a computer completely from scratch or worse actually. I tried to download pictures from an sd card and that was a complete nightmare. It was worse than slow. It would have taken atleast week to download 500 pics. This purchase was a complete mistake. I tried to give it a chance and figure it out but after a few days of almost zero progress and endless frustration I returned it.	3	1	0	0	2
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Will NEVER buy another Samsung product. This device has a KNOWN issue with the touch screen where after some time, it will no longer respond to touch except for via the supplied pen. I.e., the touch screen no longer responds to your finger. I went through the extremely painful process to obtain an RMA number from tech support and ship the device to a repair center, only to be contacted by the repair company claiming there was ""physical damage"" to the device (no way - it was absolutely mint, and I packaged it EXTREMELY well using layers of bubble wrap and an oversized box with a lot of packing material inside). They were trying to extort approximately $250 from me to repair it. All because of a KNOWN problem with the touch screen. I am beyond unsatisfied. Cutting my losses and buying another brand of Chromebook, preferably from a company who stands behind their product."	1	1	0	1	4
Perfect laptop for students, especially you already own a powerful workstation. The device is light and thin. The screen ratio is different from many other laptops, but it works really fine for reading and coding. The color is amazing.The touch screen helps sometimes, but using surface pen on the laptop doesn't give good experience. The touchpad feels smooth and supports many gestures. WIndows hello is really handy and fast.One of the speaker of my device is flawed, but i got the compensation. Some people may need more USB ports.	2	8	2	3	3
Bought this for my boyfriend daughter for Christmas and we love it for her. It arrive in perfect condition. She wanted a laptop for Christmas and when I found this one I immediately got it because it was the size I was looking for and she is only 9 so its perfect. LOVE IT!!!!!	2	0	0	1	2
So i bought this laptop because my 15” hp laptop of 6 years died on me. I needed something for college and for movies and lookswise its really nice! It runs great too. But my only complaints is how the touch pad feels, it has that irritating feel that you get when you touch computer paper (if you know what i mean). & the laptop has this noise, like you can hear the laptop running basically. Its not super loud but its noticeable. I bought this to also give a real review on it and to post pictures of how it looks since no one seems to have it on youtube -.-	2	6	3	8	3
got it on 1-9-18, today, so far so good system is very fast (i installed extra 8gb ddr4) but with 8gb is very fast, I'll use it mainly for VMs and 1 or 2 games, but is very nice setup for someone with $699 that wants a powerful & upgradeable pc to play games or work. I've had 3 acer laptops over the years but the keyboard on this one is great.PS: bought from coldriver20 (thanks guys)PS2: I hate win10 but nothing to do, best to do is dual boot with linux.PS3: other memory i got: Patriot Memory Performance Viper DDR4 8GB SODIMM PC4-19200 (2400MHZ) PV48G240C5S Red	3	6	5	8	0
Horrible product for any college student. This laptop won’t let you access anything unless it’s in the Microsoft store. There is an option to bypass that but it doesn’t work. Will return asap!	2	0	0	1	5
I can say that I become a little bit disappointed when started using the notebook. I really thought that an I5 with 8Gb would be much faster. Maybe Windows 10 demand a lot of memory. Was necessary google for some tutorial that could help me to how to optimize the configuration. Add some more memory would be the second alternative but it would cost some money that is not available at this moment.	3	9	3	9	3

"My husband is not a ""tech"" type of guy but he really wanted to learn how to use a computer. We got his this laptop and he has not left it alone! He is surfing the web, sending emails and using MS Office. Thank you for making such an intuitive laptop."	3	9	3	9	3

This is a decent low-end full service laptop. It comes without all the junk you often find on low-ends, so I didn't have to spend a lot of time removing bloatware.This was purchased a basic laptop to use internet, word processing and email primarily. I would not purchase it if your intention is to watch videos or other screen intensive uses. The screen display is subpar compared to others and the refresh rate rather slow. It says 1080p but seems to be less than that.I do like the fingerprint scanner since I was able to enter multiple people and don't have to rely on everyone to remember the PW.In the end, you get what you pay for and this is a good value.	3	9	2	8	3
"This computer is advertised as having a ""quad core"" processor which would seem to imply that at a minimum it is not slow. My experience with this machine for a few months now can best be summed up in one word, ""disappointed"". This computer is so slow that when using Microsoft Word, Edge, or Outlook, the screen display cannot even keep up with my slow typing. It lags at least a word behind. Very awkward. In addition it is incapable of going more than one level deep into any web site. If there are pages with photos to look through it simply stops and freezes. It has been OK for the purpose I intended which is reading my Kindle books using your Kindle for PC software, although it often takes more that a minute for the program to open. I would not recommend this computer to anyone who has even average speed requirements."	2	0	0	1	5
"I debated with myself over the screen size; how small a screen could I live with? I also wanted it to be as light as possible. I opted for a larger screen, but I find that it's heavier than I wanted for my carry-around laptop so I could leave my bigger and very expensive MacBook Pro at home. In hindsight, I think I could live with a smaller screen, perhaps 12"".I also debated about the RAM and disk size. Disk size is actually far less important on a ChromeBook than it is on a Mac or PC. All your stuff is in the cloud. It only stores what you're working on at the moment on disk. You don't even have to copy files up/down. It does that in the background as you work with the Chrome apps like spreadsheets and documents. You don't even have to look at how much space is available on disk. I opted for 4GB RAM rather than 2GB, because the unit was still around $200. That's an unbelievable price compared to any Mac or PC.What I love about this ChromeBook is:- It sleeps and wakes instantly- Multiple people can log into their own accounts (with a Gmail login). I don't ever let anyone ""borrow"" my login.- Battery power seems to be infinite. As I use it, it lasts all day between charges.- It integrated with my Android phone so I don't have to type my password when I wake it. If the phone is connected on bluetooth and unlocked, you can just click your login photo. (This is optional.)- There's no system administration, no virus software needed.- Any work that I do on my Mac (or PC) are instantly available on the ChromeBook. No copying files to a USB, emailing to myself, or wondering where the latest version was. It's just there.- It's very secure. It's secure enough that I won't worry if it's lost or stolen. Everything is in the Google cloud. Nothing is stored on the device that can be recovered by a thief.For me, it's the perfect second/travel laptop. I still have my power user MacBook Pro for video and photo editing. This will do simple things like cropping photos, but it's not meant for heavy duty tasks. For 90% of people, this will do everything one needs.One note for Windows users is the one thing you'll have to learn is that everything is easier and simpler. It feels more like a smartphone with a big screen and full-size keyboard, exactly what I wanted."	3	9	0	2	2

Great laptop and very good experience so far. I received the product same as described on site. Also a good services and received it just in two days. I am a happy customer.	3	6	2	8	3
OMG!!! I love it!! I researched all chromebooks for any entire week before making my decision on this one and it did not disappoint. The package was so light when it was delivered, that I thought that they sent me the wrong item. It could easily fit inside a woman's purse without issue. It's absolutely beautiful (but that's not the real reason it's so amazing). It's very fast and easy to set up. It instantly started when I opened it and had all of my forms, calendar, email, etc., from the moment I entered my Google email. It was set up in less than 5 minutes. It allows you to take a tour of the device right after setup, but honestly, it's so easy to use (especially if you already have a Samsung device) that it doesn't take long to figure any of it out. The speed is very swift and I can bounce from one thing to the next. My Wi-Fi was recognized immediately upon opening the device, which I've never seen happen with any other device (without prompting it first). I'm certain that it will slow down over time, as with any computer, but for now it's perfect. I love that it already has a large internal memory space, but what's even better is that it has the option for expandable memory (SD card slot- see photo) I am very pleased with my purchase and hope to get many years out of it.	1	1	0	1	4
The delivery was very quick without any damage to the laptop. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. Smooth interface and no lags. cheers to Amazon.	2	5	2	3	4
I purchased this laptop for out of town use to play World of Warcraft. But to my surprise it can handle games like Witcher 3 on high detail with absolutely no issue. If you are looking for a budget friendly mid ranged gaming laptop, then Acer has done a wonderful job with this laptop.	3	6	5	8	0
in 2nd day of use....speakers are making static noise (disturbances) ...while playing audio from youtube.I see similar issue reported by other customers.....seems to be real issue not just with me.Dell has to fix this	3	7	3	8	0
Amazing feel and fast to operate. Definitely worth getting the i7 extra RAM. Only drawback would be the lack of ports. One usb and one display. Likely need a surface dock to be completely satisfied with this laptop. Other than that, amazing.	2	7	2	3	3

WHOA!!!!!! SUPER NICE! This laptop really impresses me. The 360 hinge is super strong and goes all the way around. They touchscreen display is also really bright and sensitive like a high end tablet. The only thing I would say I would have liked is maybe different colors, but this color suits me just fine. Overall this is a great value. I use it everyday to browse the web, check email, and use office. I dont do any gaming or video editing. I have yet to travel with it, but once I do I can update the review if anything comes up, but for now its great.	2	9	0	2	4
This is a nice machine. My only issue is that the display casing is weak. I feel I need to be extra careful when opening the laptop. Besides that though I love it. Plays my games well and doesn't look gaudy like so many other gaming laptops. If you are looking for game performance Gamer_Chris23 has done a bunch of videos on youtube.	3	7	2	8	0

This is my first Chromebook after years of using a laptop. I love this machine. It's perfect for what I need to do. The loading time is fast and the screen is bright and clear. I did have to get use to the keyboard but after reading the shortcuts, I have no problem. It's nice that I can download some Play Store apps. I wish more app developers will start making their apps optimized for the Chromebook...hopefully in the future.	1	1	0	1	4

Bought this as a back up for my desk top, to create CAD drawings away from home and the most important thing, to run my Oculus Rift Touch I just bought. The specs are great for what I needed. It booted right up, easy set up, took the programs I needed to use. I believe the red keyboard is too bright but can live with it. The only downfall is Windows 10. Wish we had another choice. Started to do some updates and it took 3 days to get them loaded. Not Acers fault but need more options. Great buy for the money!	3	6	5	8	0

"The kind of user I am: I live in the cloud, use almost all Google services, have been using a Chromebook Pixel as my primary work computer for about 3 years now. I have an Apple imac at home and a Windows laptop too, although I dont remember when last I turned on my windows laptop. Oh, and I know a thing or 2 about consumer electronics from a past job.For a user like me, this chromebook is *almost* perfect. If I could, I would give it 4.6 stars. You'll find from the other reviews the pros and cons described more comprehensively, I'll just focus on a few things:*** The cons I kind of disagree with ***- hardware ""bugs"" (e.g. speaker cracking, etc): I haven't personally experienced any of them. I do have one (super minor) issue with the sealing of the bottom aluminum sheet, so I just ordered a replacement, but honestly, at this stage I think I would rate the HW as top notch (given the price point)- Software ""bugs"" (e.g. android apps not always working perfectly...): I did experience a number of them... but I do not see that as an issue for 3 reasons. (1) the availability of (almost all) the Android apps I care about on this makes it effectively a wonderful tablet+laptop replacement, so in the grand scheme of things... I can live with a few bugs here and there (2) I trust that these bugs will disappear over time and (3) I have not yet found any ""critical"" bug for my work (/play) flows- keyboard ergonomics: agree it takes a bit to get used to the layout. given that I do use a full keyboard in parallel (when sitting at my desk I switch to a desktop keyboard), I am still sometimes hitting the wrong key when wanting to press backspace. But again, i see this as a very minor issue. Overall, the keyboard ergonomics are top notch given the size- backlighting of keyboard (lacks it): I was bummed about that initially (I often work in the dark). In practice, this is NOT an issue I have: the keys are sufficiently reflective and the screen sufficiently bright (at the right angle) that I can type effortlessly in the dark. I am typing this review in pitch dark room with screen brightness at 3 and I can effortlessly read all of the keys*** my cons or why I would give it 4.6 and not 5 ***- the trackpad is good (should I say great) but not perfect. I am expecting a stellar trackpad. This is almost but not it.- the speakers are weak. works totally fine, but I want more- the screen bezels are too large: the display is AMAZING, now I want more of it in the same form factor. In particular, at the bottom of the screen, there is currently 1 inch of vertical space (the part where the Samsung logo sits) that screams for becoming part of the actual display*** my pros or why I give it such a high rating ***They got the basics right: battery life is stellar, screen is stellar, size/weight top notch, keyboard very comfortable, trackpad works really well, it is appropriately powered, the memory and storage are sufficient to just not have to think about it.It is truly a convertible that is replacing 2 devices (laptop & tablet) without making compromises I can't live without). I LOVE this.Their bells and whistles actually help! microsd port is great to have, and so is the stylus (I thought of it as gimmicky, but I actually use it almost every day)price point is really good for that kind of quality"	1	1	0	1	4

When I ordered it, it came in broken. It wouldn't turn on at all. They sent me a new one and it took 10 minutes to load. I couldn't even set it up, because it took too long. I ended up returning it and buying a dell. Even though it was cheap, it wasn't worth it.	2	0	0	1	5
This is a good system for the price. However, out of the box it was very slow and lagged quite a bit compared to other 4g ram systems I have had. Increasing the ram to 8gb has helped considerably	3	1	0	0	2

This computer has had issues since the day I bought it. The technical support is with techs whom I can barely understand. They want me to send it to them and it could take 5-12 business days. I will never buy another Dell computer.	3	4	3	2	3
I bought this laptop brand new. After the first week, the charger came apart where the clear plastic blue light connects. Now, the wires are sticking out of the charger and have a potential for causing an electrical fire. I called customer service and they say it is not covered by the warranty that it comes with and I would need to have to buy a new one. This company does not stand behind their products and apparently have no regards for fire safety. This is not a simple wear an tear issue for a computer I have owned for less than a year.	3	9	3	8	0
