I found this cheaply made. It has a solid casing but the mouse finger pad is loose and doesn't work half the time. Also works backwards compared to others. It crashed/ froze everytime I turned it on. I returned it two days after I opened it. Part of it is Windows 10, compared to Chrome it is slow and takes up too much memory for basic functions.	0	0	0	1	2
"I purchase on amazon almost every day and this is the first poor review I am leaving. I was so excited to like this laptop, I love the color, it's super light weight and portable. But upon first use I noticed that it was dead on arrival, which is odd in my opinion, especially if it was ""certified refurbished"" and checked prior to shipment. I thought it may just be a random glitch and overlooked it. The slow speed I could not over look then the snow screen became more regular...after not even a week of having it in my possession. I expect a full refund and if not then I will go directly to Amazon."	0	0	0	1	2

Great laptop. Does everything I need it to do. Very slim and lightweight	2	6	2	2	2
value for money	2	6	2	2	2
This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!	3	7	3	8	4
I loved it! I'm using it for Video editing, Auto cad, Photoshop, playing online games, watching UHD movies and internet browsing!For me it's fast! and the shipping as well! didn't expected it to be so fast. Well packaged, it came to me safe and sound!Overall, I'm so happy with it and the service! Thanks so much!	3	7	3	8	4
I bought this as an upgrade replacement to a seven year-old Acer laptop and I'm not disappointed. The amount of manufacturer-install cruft was minimal - I had all the sales junk uninstalled in under an hour - and the SSD drive means it boots in seconds.My only complaints are that A. they made some questionable choices about the keyboard layout (the DEL / HOME / END combo got moved around to make way for a POWER button? Why on Earth?) and B. the exact same model is available for $400 from Acer's website minus the SSD, which is < $100 here on Amazon. So I ended up paying a $100 premium to have someone else to do the SSD drive and Windows install for me. I'm not overly broken up about that.	3	7	3	8	4
Pros- Overall pretty fast performance mode is about 3.5 GHZRuns games smoothlyCONs the battery drains insanely fast.Will sometimes lag too much for an i7	3	7	3	8	4
I bought two of these to replace some aged laptops. I was worried because of price and there not my normal vendor. I have to say I love these laptops. I replaced the spinning rust with and SSD from my old laptops to save money. Reinstalled Windows and away we go. I have to say I like the touch pad on these more than my Macbook Pro. Normally I hate touch pads but I used it to setup the laptop. The real test if the wife and kids would like them. I keep checking in with them to see what they think and they said they like or love them as well. My daughter is like I can play all my games on max settings which the old one couldn't do. I have to give ACER a big thumbs up because my family really enjoys these laptops.	3	7	3	8	4
This laptop is a reasonable price but its still not worth it. I should have sent it back right from the start but thought I would hang in there with it. I am on a 400 mps wifi with a router that supports up to 600 and I am barely squeaking out 120 in the same room as the router. All other laptops (HP) have no issues reaching over 300. It is extremely slow and half the time will not process links even with pop up blocker off. Buy a better machine, I wish I did.	3	7	3	8	4
It was running slow when I received it. I had to set windows up to store everything but the system on the second hard drive, and it slowed down even more. Once I formatted the 1tb hard drive and reinstalled windows it has been running like a champ. It boots in about 15 seconds from completely shut off, and it runs fast. It is upgradeable to Solid State Hard drives all around, so I will probably upgrade the hard drives in this computer.	3	7	3	8	4
Very timely shipping, received in great shape and worked right out of the box with no issues to report.wife was thrilled with her new laptop. Definitely would buy another one if I needed to.	3	7	3	8	4
Works great and is fast. I would buy again.	3	7	3	8	4
I bought this strictly as a Sims 3 & 4 gaming laptop. It is perfect for both games with over 30GB of CC and Mods used, HQ settings on both games with no lag at all.	3	7	3	8	4
love this one, quick and truly the most bang for your buck	3	7	3	8	4
Laptop arrived, and is fast. I play Sims 4, City Skylines on it. They run fine in highest settings. It's a good deal.	3	7	3	8	4
I have onlly had this a month but I love it.. It is smooth and very fast and the screen is fantastic. I would tell anyone shopping for something like this to go for this one.. Priced right and has all the credentials of a great laptop.	3	7	3	8	4

Great vendor, terrible laptop. What good is all that CPU and RAM if the hard drive is so slow? It was intolerable - i returned it. I think this would be a great laptop if you wanted to sink another couple hundred for a SSD and void the warranty but I didn’t. Found one with same specs and SSD online elsewhere for just a little more.	3	7	3	8	4
I had some issues when it came out of the box. It isn't updated to the latest windows so it needs to be updated	3	7	3	8	4
Package came on time due to being a prime member. Package was neat. Laptop is terrible. Turned it on and plugged it in and had to wait 3.5 hours for it to update. Used it for about an hour or so after waiting Hours for it to be done updating, BOOM, mouse pad stopped working. Horrible horrible	3	7	3	8	4
This laptop seems to work fine, usually powers up fast, was relatively easy to setup and use, and generally just works. It does NOT come with a CD/DVD drive, so expect to spend another $20-50 for a plug in variety if you need one. This laptop does come with a lot of bloatware and I am still working to remove the non-essentials. Overall it feels a little on the cheap (flimsy side) relative to an HP laptop I have at the office, but for light use at home and as a back up to my almost new Dell all-in-one with a dead motherboard, it's fine. Packaging was very poor. There was very little material to cushion the laptop box so it knocked around a lot inside the shipping box, and the shipping box arrived damaged. It appears the laptop was undamaged, but I am a little worried that something will show up later.	3	7	3	8	4
This is a nice machine. It is speedy and has good display. I would have appreciated a user manual already loaded on disk but I had to hunt for one on the Acer website. The trackpad seems over sensitive but I haven't looked for an adjustment within Windows.Overall, I recommend this PC.BTW, it came on time and was well packaged.	3	7	3	8	4
husband very satisfied with laptop	3	7	3	8	4
I ordered two LaptopsLaptops are ok butI'm not sure that is brand new because the secure sticker on box was broken on both laptops.	3	7	3	8	4
The keyboard doesnt light up and i dont like that	3	7	3	8	4
The perfect laptop.	3	7	3	8	4
Its a pretty good laptop so far. Reloading (to get rid of the Bloat...) seems to take a really long time but that is windows and not a hit on the laptop. So far its nice for the price....and the DVD...its real not fake....so who ever said that was full of it.	3	7	3	8	4
Easy to operate.	3	7	3	8	4
The laptop can run small programs like chrome, YouTube, Netflix, etc. But it can not run big games. Mine doesn't even lock when I close the screen and the fan can be very loud and it sounds like the radioactive detecting sound. I would not recommend because the graphics card is what kills the performance and so does the bad motherboard.	3	7	3	8	4
The computer, the speed is great. But I despise windows 10. Also, I have returned it because it advertises a CD/DVD writer, but it not only does not have a writer, but does not come with a DVD or CD player. I have a ton of software that I have to load onto it, that comes with CDs/DVDs so after spending days setting it up with my preferences, I begin to install software only to learn that I don't have a DVD/CD rom. Also, Windows 10 forces you to create an account to log in with. It is annoying.	3	7	3	8	4
Do not buy this computer. Hours spent trying to update windows 10 and still not fixed. Between Acer and Microsoft this has been a huge waste of time. Customer support for both have been incompetent.	3	7	3	8	4
I ordered this laptop and noticed it was running slower than it should, so I had a certified and licensed technician check it out. Turns out, the motherboard was bad, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement which couldn’t be done, they could only send me a refund and I could reorder. By the time everything was done, I had my refund, and I was ready to reorder, the price for the laptop had gone up by $30. I called customer service and asked if there was anything that could be done since it was a problem that came right out of the manufacturer, and because I really did want this laptop, they said no because it’s being sold by a third party and there is no way for me to speak to the manufacturer directly as I have checked. Upon further inspection, this isn’t even the same laptop that I had originally ordered. The specs have been slightly altered, there is no longer a SSD in this laptop, and it’s overall just lower quality than the laptop I wanted. So, in the end, I regret ever even considering spending money on this laptop and you shouldn’t either.	3	7	3	8	4
It came, and the laptop runs great, but the thing on the side that looks like a cd rom is not. Its a dummy.	3	7	3	8	4
Was easy to set up, especially for a tech-challenged old man. I was expecting a half-inch thick instruction book but it's all done interactively. You power it up and follow the prompts. It took a half day to load everything; you have to be patient. It serves all my needs, shopping banking, etc. I don't do games or movies on it so I can't comment on its capabilities there. The default browser is Microsoft Edge; I managed to change it to IE11 which is easier for me. For the money, you can't go wrong. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.	3	0	0	8	2
If I could give something NO STARS I would’ve. Worst laptop I’ve seen since the 90’s. Slow to load . Non responsive, everything you do NOT WANT in a laptop. And by the way ITS NOT RED ITS ORANGE. Go find something else if you read this review.	3	0	0	8	2
Laptop sucks. Updates and loads extra slow. It took 22 hours for my laptop to download and install all windows updates. Laptop never connects to my wifi and my laptop battery drains faster than it should because it's trying so hard to connect to the wifi. It will connect for a minute and disconnect but it will show that it's still connected to my wifi. I bought an Ethernet cable but I don't want an Ethernet cable to my laptop. I should've just got a desktop computer I guess. The point of a laptop is to take it around with you, not sitting on your desk hooked to an Ethernet cable because it can't connect to WiFi. I've had this laptop for about two weeks and I've only used it once because it was hooked to an Ethernet cable. Other times I've tried it without the Ethernet cable and it doesn't work. Waste of money if you ask me.	3	0	0	8	2
I am a student who purchased this Ideapad to use specifically for paper writing and research for school. I did not have really high expectations about browsing speed etc. Alas though, I have had it for maybe a month and during this time it has frozen at least weekly to the point of manual restart, it connects/disconnects to the internet constantly making research take so much longer than it should as I have to constantly refresh the pages until it decides it wants to connect. I know the problem is not my internet as my phone and ipad remain connected.	3	0	0	8	2

"I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them ""programs"" and ""software"") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews.Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6"" HD ""Premium Chromebook"" is not really ""premium."" For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10"" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15"" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to ""trade-up"" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15"" Chromebook as a spare at the office.My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it.The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be ""HD,"" but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10"" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15"" screen a 7/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing.The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them.The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle.Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a ""premium"" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger.In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities.UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model."	3	1	0	0	2
I purchased this for my wife to use in the Master's program she has started. She was frustrated by our old computer, and this works like a breeze. The Chromebook OS lets her have immediate start-up, while our Office 365 account allows her to use a full host of Microsoft products online, if she needs something outside the Google products. She had been extremely pleased and wished she would have purchased a Chromebook years ago.	3	1	0	0	2
I bought these, specifically, for my 4 kids whom I homeschool. I didn't want anything outlandishly expensive; just very basic. Something they can do their schoolwork on, typing courses, etc. This computer totally fits the bill. The screen is big, the keyboard is great, and even though it doesn't have too many bells and whistles, this is perfect for our needs. And the price?! YOU BETCHA. Totally satisfied with our purchase.	3	1	0	0	2
I wanted to get a laptop for my stepdad because his was infected with so many different things that it didn't work properly anymore. So, when I saw this I couldn't believe my luck at the amazing price! I got it in the mail yesterday and set it up for him so it would be ready when he got home from work. It runs so smooth;y that I couldn't believe it! It answers commands immediately, the display color is fantastic, it has great speakers, he can use a regular mouse on it, and SO many other things! I'm EXTREMELY happy with this purchase, and my stepdad was even happier. THANKS GUYS!	3	1	0	0	2
Great deal - Great Chromebook! Arrived today and booted up instantly with great performance. I was up and running in minutes. For the price its perfect for my school classes and budget. The display is HUGE and clear for my needs. Its a NON-GLOSS display and perfect for all the basics. Good keyboard and soft touch keys. It also has plenty of room to rest your palm so thats nice but I always use an external mouse. I never had a Chromebook and was surprised there is NO Delete Key. I looked over and over and NO delete key. I find that when you Right Click you can delete stuff. I thought it was listed as Black its really a Dark Charcoal Grey which I love even more! Professional packing and all.	3	1	0	0	2
"Excellent Alternative to Windows PCs...FINALLY!!! New, this is around $300, mine is ""Refurbished"" for $188. And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS. One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative). No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans! Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser. Google provides lifetime Free Virus Protection, An Entire Suite of Office Apps called Google Docs (no Outlook or MS Works needed...YAY!) plus Hundreds more Apps at No Charge! Try it, You'll Like it."	3	1	0	0	2
So far, very happy with this Chromebook. For my daughter, for college. Very different than a Windows-based computer, but not too hard to figure out (And there is LOTS off online help and tutorials!) Would certainly recommend!	3	1	0	0	2
Refurbished, really.Can't tell, looks great, sounds great and works perfect. I have to admit this is my first Chrome book, alittle different. Not like my android phone and not like my Microsoft Surface, so there will be a learning curve. So far so good.Update: damm, the price went $50.00. Goto walmart you can get a brand new one for $179.00	3	1	0	0	2

As a student, im not exactly rolling in money but needed a laptop for school so a Chromebook was a given. This product shipped on time, had no visible scratches and the cheapest i have found and has had no problems in these first few weeks. The only thing thats not quite as good as i wanted (given the price isn't a big deal at all) is just the track pad is a bit finicky. all being said is a solid product and i wasn't even able to tell it was refurbished.	3	1	0	0	2
I bought my first Acer Chromebook several years ago and loved it. I thought that I'd try another one but a larger one when the keyboard on my older, smaller model wore out (keys just stopped working). So I bought this. It's just ok. The battery life is good but I expected it to work faster than it does because it's supposed to have a faster processor speed. Occasionally, the machine slows down to a crawl and I'm not sure why. My biggest concerns: the quality of the machine and the price. There is a line that runs across the screen. I didn't notice it at first but there's a line that runs from one side of the screen to the other. It's more noticeable with the machine off than on but it upsets me that a refurbished unit would have the line. The other thing is that the overall feel of the machine is one of cheapness. My older machine was a solid little thing -- the new machine feels cheap. When I open the machine, the plastic creaks like it's not stuck together (glued? screwed?) properly. I also purchased the machine for a reasonable price then in the greatest Amazon tradition, the price dropped significantly. I requested a price match but was denied since the machine I bought came from one seller and the same machine for the less expensive price was from a different seller. I would not buy this machine again but would look for something different. Although the battery life seems better than my older, smaller machine, that's the only positive thing I see with this machine.	3	1	0	0	2

I didn't have a problem with this machine until right after the 30 day return window expired. I have been having technical issues shortly after. I would get black lines running across my screen, the machine would freeze. I would have to do a reboot. I then received a message to reinstall the operating system. I was able to do that successfully. Once I did that, I did a powerwash just in case. My machine was once again functional...for about 3 hours. Since that time, this has happened a total of 5 times. I've even contacted technical support (ACER)...they were able to help me get up and running the second time, but it still keeps happening. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a product seller. I will not buy an ACER product ever again due to this experience and have bought Chromebooks from other manufacturers as gifts and they are still up and running for years.	3	1	0	0	2

"I purchased this for a friend and now I'm jealous. I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself if I could get one equipped with a much larger hard drive. I currently use the Chrome browser in my Windows 10 laptop. It's super quick and a lot more reliable.Update: 2 weeks later. Still running like a champ. My friend went to this from a 7"" tablet because, well, we're all getting older and the eyes don't see as good as before. Bigger screen, easy to see. This is more or less a large tablet with a keyboard. I like the fact that we didn't need to get any security software to protect it, Google seems to have that under control"	3	1	0	0	2
I was in the market for a Chromebook to do my school work on as an educator and not break my pocketbook purchasing it. This one fit the bill. So far so good. I have been using it daily, numerous times a day for over a month now. It is a great laptop for my educational classroom needs.	3	1	0	0	2

This is a good computer for what it is, and what it is is a Chromebook. That means it is a laptop running Google’s Chrome OS. The operating system is fast and very user friendly.One thing that people will complain about is the amount of space that the laptop comes with. It’s about 15gb. Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you don’t need to (or more accurately, can’t) download programs. That being said, don’t expect to be downloading games and movies.The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. I’ll explain later)The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when it’s not skipping frames.With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection.If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu. I won’t get into that, just simply explain that it’s possible.For your money, it is a good machine and I actually enjoy using it.	3	1	0	0	2
I give this 5 stars.First, it's only very inexpensive computer. But what you get in screen size and keyboard is very good for the money. I bought this for my church to do QuickBooks Online software. It looks like this was a wise decision since we do not need any onboard storage (computer has some though). I am impressed with the speed and screen brightness. I have watched movies and videos online without problems.I think I may buy one for my family to use. It is solid and does not have any loose or poorly fitting parts, but it is not as solidly built as a MacBook, but what can you expect for 1/5 fo the price. It is well worth the money I spent. If you have a kid or an older parent this should be a great computer for them because no Windows updates or virus software to fight or confuse the user. Be aware it is Google-centric and takes a google account to fully access all features.I have not tried games or anything like that on the computer but I am impressed with the machine compared to my daughter's Chromebook computer (3-4 years old), it's much snappier and the screen is much better in brightness and clarity.	3	1	0	0	2
the laptop or Chromebook I got it is old. this is not new, and also it has scratches and gaps in top of the notebook. I am really sad because it had good comments in the reviews. I am not able to return it because I do not have enough time. I will travel out of the country, but you will be careful because we are paying for good stuff.	3	1	0	0	2
My kids took over my other computers, so I decided to get one of my own. I enjoy the convenience of having a personal computer where all my passwords are mine, etc. This computer is sometimes a little slow, which was disappointing. But I suppose that it what I get with a dual-core. It doesn't have any other issues. I use it for email, social media, google docs and spreadsheets, calendar, YouTube, online shopping, and the like. I don't use it for gaming or music, so I can't say how it would do for that. It holds a charge very well!	3	1	0	0	2
Very satisfied with this. Up and working on it within minutes of opening the box.	3	1	0	0	2
This is exactly what I was looking for! It’s ridiculously easy to set up and use! If you have a GMAIL account it seriously does all the work for you,just put in your email address adjust some settings and there ya go all done lolI didn’t need a laptop for anything too extreme or specific,just wanted to have a place to type papers,listen to music and download pictures so this was perfect for all of that!The price was perfect for me right now too! It came packaged with bubble wrap and a secure box! Everything works on it and it did come with a charging cord 😊	3	1	0	0	2
So far so good. I've had several Acer desk tops and have been very pleased with them.(My only misstep was the Acer Aspire 'All-in-One'. Nice computer but very limited to add-on resources.)This laptop is pretty new and have not used it a whole lot at this point.I added a $90.00 Crucial 8 GB memory (Now at 16 w. 32 capacity) - easy install and it works fine. I'm not putting a heavy load on the system or gaming - so it suits my needs as expected.I have a Acer desktop that is my primary computer. (the laptop is basically a 'fail safe') - but, with the added mobility and comparatively small footprint.Looks nice - keyboard feels solid. A little clumsy opening the cover - maybe because it is so new. (A bit stiff.) But that's not a big issue.Full HD images seem a little washed out - until you get the screen in just the right position.	3	1	0	0	2
This was my first time making a computer purchase on Amazon. Wasnt a big deal since it was for my kids to do homework and with such a reasonable price i figured why not. I was soooo amazed once I opened the package. The computer was refurbished but it looked brand spaking new to me! I the screen was nice and wide. I seriously wanted to give my children my laptop and keep this 1.This is definitely worth the buy! my daughter is headed to college an i will be making a purchase again to present as a graduation gift. Its not heavy or bulky, again its a great screen size and resolution, everything works as expected! Im really impressed and did i mention the price....very much worth it!	3	1	0	0	2

This is my first chromebook and although I am still confused at how to get it to do some things that I've always done on Windows PC, I am impressed. This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I like that it turns on automatically when I open it. The packaging was plain but very secure and my laptop came without a scatch! I saw some others say they hadn't gotten a charging cable but I think they just missed it. You have to dig all the way to the bottom of the box, where there is smaller piece of cardboard separating the charging cable from the rest of the packaging. I almost missed it myself and was worried I would have to return. Overall, I really like it even though I'm new to chromebook.	3	1	0	0	2
I like it because it is good for basic users.	3	1	0	0	2
The laptop is EXTREMELY fast, much better than I anticipated. I use it to do homework while watching TV, instead of using our desktop. It's a chromebook, but I search the internet faster than prior gaming laptops I've owned. The machine runs like a champ. This was one of the best purchases I've made in the past couple of years. You usually get what you pay for, but this is a bargain and a great machine.	3	1	0	0	2
My 10 yrs. old son love it. screen is so big and enough fast to process. I think it is very good for school kids to do their homework, net surfing and watching Youtube. and I don't feel it's refub product. Great price.	3	1	0	0	2
WARNING: my package came without the charging cord. When I asked Amazon to issue a credit so that I could buy a cord on its own they would not offer any solution other than return and refund of the entire item.	3	1	0	0	2
I was looking for something lightweight and fast. This is both of those. Going from a Windows OS to the Chrome OS was something I wasn't sure about. I've always used Windows, but I bought my 81 year old mom a Chromebook for Christmas, and she loves it. I figured if she can figure it out, I can too. Setup is simple and straightforward, just log into your Google account, if you have one. If not, you can create one.. I bought a flash drive for pics and files. I added my VPN, that setup was simple too. The price can't be beat, the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified. I'd definitely recommend this	3	1	0	0	2

I purchased two of these for my girls. They were perfect for the use they'll receive. Educational apps, learning how to navigate a computer, and of course YouTube and Netflix. The price was very competitive, especially considering that I was looking to purchase two. The delivery was also much faster than anticipated. Thanks seller, the girls loved them!	3	1	0	0	2
First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed! Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself....it's a powerful laptop for a Chromebook I've run multiple pages in HD videos streaming with very minimal lag (due to area of internet). But what I love the most is the charger which is very important as to how long ur laptop will last, not only is it super fast at charging but it is delicate and easy to plug in and it pops off as a safety mechanism I believe...either way it never overheats it charges really fast even during heavy use and it has options to really dim down the screen to save energy. It's like a tablet but you can do way more and run apps with easy... A must have if you like to entertain your family or others as the speakers on this babe are crisp and clear. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone/iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs. So get one for sure and forget about charging ur phone and looking like a boy who can out down his Gameboy lol jk	3	1	0	0	2
"Love it. It runs fast, I can watch YouTube/Netflix no problem, the sound is decent, the screen is really big and it's easy to use. No caps key, but I quickly trained myself to hold shift down for a capital letter when necessary, which is often because I use this primarily for my online college classes. Does everything. Had an issue accessing a few web pages at first due to ""privacy issues"" but the problem fixed itself. Haven't met a webpage I cant load. Highly recommend."	3	1	0	0	2
"I bought this to replace a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit. This Acer is much bigger with its 15.6"" screen. Right out of the box, as usual the setup was almost instant, and I love the feel of the keyboard. I saw a sticker saying to open from both ends to find cord, and it is hard to notice when you're excited to get the chromebook out of its packing. Don't throw the cord away! It was packed very well.So far I love it, and will update if I find it isn't what I thought, but I bought it for the price, size, and the fact that it was a Chromebook. Very impressed with the quality so far!"	3	1	0	0	2

My first and probably last chromebook.1) Computer arrived in pretty much brand new looking finished. I easily could have mistook this for a new computer, except that it was still configured as a meeting chromebox and required Acer tech support troubleshoot the issue with me for an hour before being able to login to the computer.2) OS update allows me to use android apps on the computer. However, the two apps I use most crash every time i open them. So I'm back to accessing on them on the browser. I like my apps better, but apps don't work on this thing, despite what the OS description said. If you want to access an app or service, its done through your Chrome browser, not the androidapp.3) My biggest complaint about this computer is the keyboard. The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key. Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position. Its extremely cumbersome using the keyboard despite its full size. Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it. If that search button wasnt in such a stupidly designed location, this would be a 3 star review.The main redeeming value of this computer, and only reason its not a 1 star review is the ease of use in terms of the Chrome OS. If you know chrome, you already know the computer. It would have been nice if the seller would have set the puter back to factory stats prior to mailing it. 1 hour of my life wasted troubleshooting that little mix up.	3	1	0	0	2
This is my first laptop/Chromebook. I am everything Google, so this works out perfectly! I use a desktop computer and my cell ph mostly, but needed something for downstairs which this works great. It came fully refurbished, clean. Their is 2 scratch marks barely noticeable on the casing, but other than that and for the price of under $150.00 I feel I got an awesome deal.	3	1	0	0	2
My daughter recently change schools and at their old school they needed Apple but at her new school she's used Chromebook. To get a Chromebook at this price is so worth it she is so excited and has no problem navigating through different websites. I'm absolutely buying another one for my sons. The seller was super nice and sent me an e-mail asking to rate the chrome book and if I have any problems email him which I thought it was very kind.	3	1	0	0	2
I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it.It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it. I never thought about buying Refurbished, but now I'm sorry that I didn't do it before. I bought a new laptop at Best Buy and could have gotten a much better one that was refurbished for the price that I paid. Go REFURBISHED	3	1	0	0	2
This machine looks and performs flawlessly!I bought it for my father and he finally has a portable computing device for all his ?? Computing requirements!

"Purchased for my son. Others had more features, but my son wanted a large screen and he was initially very happy. EXCEPT he says space bar does not work well. I wish he had let me buy him one with more RAM, more GB, SSDL --there were several available with a bit smaller screen. Had we gotten one of those, he would probably be happier. He recently told me, ""A smaller screen would be ok."" Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is too late for an exchange. I would be thrilled to purchase him a better one!"	3	1	0	0	2
This laptop is NICE !Purchased this for my 9yr old son. Im honestly a bit jealous lol . Anyways it was delivered on it's given date, and today we went through the simple set up. He is very excited to have Google Play Store. Thanks for an awesome laptop !!	3	1	0	0	2
i had this for about 7 months and its still going strong. it hasn't broke down on me yet. i mainly use it to browse the web i don't make youtube videos or do heavy task ect.. so this is perfect for me. and if i want to play a game i go on my consoles and do that. i use to browse on my tablet alot but since i got this bad boy this killed my beloved tablet. if you want a buy a laptop without spending 500-1000 dollars(im looking at you apple!) go for a chromebook and its incredibly fast once you turned it on it only takes less then 3-2 minutes to turned on.	3	1	0	0	2
Excellent price. I know it was refurbished but you wouldn't know it. The package came with a very heavy bubble wrap, which protected the computer. The set up was plug and ready. I love this Chromebook is the best. I have had Asus chrome books and I feel that the Acer is the best. I love the large screen. I love it so much that I ordered another one for my husband. I would recommend this Acer to everyone. Easy to operate and fast. Also, don't forget that it has its own Antivirus build right in the computer.	3	1	0	0	2

"Bought this for my in-laws when their Windows laptop stopped working. Keeping the old laptop updated and virus/malware free was proving to be a challenge for them. They absolutely love the simplicity of this Chromebook. Getting a 15.6"" at this price is a steal. Highly recommend for anyone who just needs a worry free machine to browse the internet."	3	1	0	0	2
For what I bought it for, it serves its purpose perfectly. I am very happy after using it for a week now. We had a Macbook Air and one of my humans spilled water on it. Game over. Couldn't afford another one so after doing some research this is a perfect band aid for a little picture management and Netflix watching. My daughter uses a Chromebook for her class so this was also a plus. Very budget friendly and we have a laptop again in the household.Update: About 2 weeks into computer , the charger went out. Charger would not charge computer. Uuuugh. Seller had no replacement for it. Remember this is a refurbished item. Be careful. Bought a new charger and is back to good. So computer works great, the process was the bummer.	3	1	0	0	2
I'm very happy with my purchase. The laptop came quickly and was well packaged. I was looking for straightforward laptop that wouldn't break the bank.

Setup was quick and easy, and the laptop has been everything I needed. Very happy with my purchase!	3	1	0	0	2

"It's OK--I was disappointed that after just a few months the action on the touchpad would deteriorate to the point where we can't use it to scroll down anymore on the screen and have to use the arrow keys--the action was always a little ""sticky"" from the get-go but now, it's even worse. I get that this is second hand, but I was hoping for the mechanics to survive longer--luckily we can switch to a mouse--"	3	1	0	0	2

"Ordered it on the 17th and received it on the 22nd (once again 2 day shipping is non existent from Amazon).Setting it up now, so far so good.. first thing I noticed is this black refurbished Chromebook with the steel colored lid came with a white cord. (why?). My other Chromebook (Acer) died that I bought in 2016. I've been using an older Acer Chromebook I bought many yrs ago, small but has never given me a problem. Bought this one to use while waiting for a new hard drive on my newer Acer (bought in 2016)that's always been unstable and just died.So far this one seems nice.. i will update my review as time goes on since i just received it today. I haven't tried the speakers or the battery life yet.. I'll update this in a month or so after i see how everything works out, but for a refurbished product, right out of the box, i'm satisfied so far.Next day: This refurbished chromebook is supposed to have at least 7 hrs battery life. i""m happy to say I used it 9.5 hrs unplugged and the meter said I had almost 4 hours left of battery use. We'll see how that works out in the months to come.1/24 Battery continues to have long life but the meter is very irregular. One minute it says i have 7 hrs and 30 mins left, an hour later it says i have 10 hrs and 40 mins left, an hour later it says I have 8 hrs and 20 mins left - either way, so far, it is long (enough) battery life.*I'm not really happy with the lack of depth of color on this chromebook - it's supposed to be non-glare and that may be contributing to the issue i have with the lack of color.. there is no enhancer (1 app avail and does nothing) and these chromebooks have no settings for color.. this particular book, the color doesn't pop, has no depth.. very disappointing compared to my other 2 chromebooks.* Speakers are just ok - nothing to write home about but they do the basic job. My biggest issue with this chromebook is the lack of color depth."	3	1	0	0	2
Laptop came on time and (mostly) works as expected. There is a key on the keyboard (the apostrophe key) that works only on the second click which is odd.

Exactly what I needed. I use a laptop for online work and my last one died on me. This is my first chromebook. I had went out and bought an 11 inch Chromebook from the store, came home and was disappointed by the screen size. Returned it and started looking on Amazon. Found this one for the same price as the 11 inch one so I was thrilled. I knew I needed a bigger screen. It seriously looks brand new and was packaged very well. Very fast for surfing which is basically all I need it for. My daughter likes to play online games on it as well. Super happy with it so far.	3	1	0	0	2
This laptop might be good for younger tech savvy people but for old people like me that just want a laptop to do their work and browse the internet, it is not for them. Everything is completely different about this thing and it is like relearning how to use a computer completely from scratch or worse actually. I tried to download pictures from an sd card and that was a complete nightmare. It was worse than slow. It would have taken atleast week to download 500 pics. This purchase was a complete mistake. I tried to give it a chance and figure it out but after a few days of almost zero progress and endless frustration I returned it.	3	1	0	0	2

As this item was purchased as a gift, I didn't try it out myself beyond ensuring that it started up. It seems to be nicely suited to the tasks intended: email, some web browsing and maybe some kindle/video watching. It is light-weight enough to not encumber and the screen is large enough to view without undue strain or feeling a truncated sense of image.I don't know how it fares with travel conditions, nor how well it connects/streams data from sources other than home base at this time, but I have no reason to doubt that it will function as was described.The keyboard takes a little adjustment, as any would, for those coming from primarily desktop or smartphone input types, but it is still easier to utilize for arthritic hands than a tablet or phone pad.	3	1	0	0	2

It was bigger than I thought which is great. This is the second chromebook I have so I wasn't amazed by all the features, but they WERE satisfactory. The speakers also work really well compared to my other chromebook. The packaging is probably what amazed me.....it came in a HUGE box that contained another box which contained a plastic bubble wrap thing that protected the chromebook. If I could buy this for someone as a present, I would. Overall, I like the chromebook and there isn't really anything that disappointed me. Also the chromebook is WAYYYY heavier than I expected.	3	1	0	0	2

The screen is big... but not really HD by any means. I am actually returning it because oddly enough, it feels like the keyboard is much smaller than a normal keyboard so I keep missing keys and have to spend time thinking about how to type on the smaller keyboard which is annoying. It could just be that the keys are tightly spaced and don't have any gaps like the other keyboards I've been used to typing on..	3	1	0	0	2

"I was skeptical, due to the fact that this computer costs less than 250. My mindset was of the idea of ""You get what you pay for.""Well, color me surprised because I am blown away by this spicy Chromebook. It gives you the real estate of a full sized computer, with the speed and reliability of a Chromebook. It does better than my Asus laptop,with every advantage on paper. The battery is a hard A+ and these units show that Chromebooks have come a long way and have applications that prevent you from having to settle.I highly recommend it."	3	1	0	0	2
I bought one of these refurbished and it completely died after only 4 months of light use. I've emailed Acer twice now because it's still under warranty and no response.

The battery life is crazy, it really goes all day. But it's lacking in processing power and the resolution takes a little to get used to. Webpages act a little strange, the headers sometimes take up massive chunks of the screen even when you scroll down. But it works well enough and you can do homework all day and hate your life while being productive. So that's...nice?	3	1	0	0	2

This was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law. The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish (no scratches or markings) and seemed to work well for about the first month and then she started having problems with two of the keys on the keyboard sticking. It doesn't make it unusable, it's just frustrating to her, otherwise I would have given it five stars.	3	1	0	0	2
I love my new laptop. It's fast and super easy to use. I was really happy that it was packaged so nicely and that it was protected. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs this for either school work or just for general use.	3	1	0	0	2
The laptop came in good condition (as expected because it was refurbished). But the charger was defective. I plugged it in and the charging light wouldn’t show. I called Acer support line and they said either the laptop or the charger might be defective. However, I went to Best Buy and purchased a new charger because I needed to use the laptop immediately. Now, the laptop is working perfectly and the new charger is great. The photo below shows the defective charger (in white) and the functional charger I purchased (in black).	3	1	0	0	2
I have not used the computer yet, so this review is strictly based upon my disappointment upon receipt of product. Although description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included, there is no power source cord included! I reached out to Amazon immediately and they offered a gift card for the cost to purchase one. However, I feel I should warn others about this scenario as it appears I am mot the first customer to experience this problem. After receiving the item, I read the questions asked area and see that others were just as frustrated as myself due to the lack of power source. The computer is meant to be a gift for my nephew and was requested specifically by him via Amazon link. My lesson learned... although a requested gift; READ EVERYTHING before purchase.	3	1	0	0	2

It was only good for surfing the web and doing personal document.. it is not compatible with a lot of thing couldn’t download itunes or photoshop ect. Wouldn’t recommended if you want more use of it!! Ps. the computer came with a scratch at the top.	3	1	0	0	2
Fantastic product. I already have given 3 of these to 3 of my daughter's and i got this one for my wife. Wish i came here first, i would have saved alot more money. They take a little getting used to but it is worth it for the kind of speed and protection they provide. My girls are completely thoughtless in what they download and these computers have proven to be impervious to this over the past 6 months.	3	1	0	0	2

Gave to my daughter for Christmas 2017. My wife's choice, not mine over a PC. Almost impossible to get a Chrome book to print to our printer was the first problem noticed. Chrome book totally failed/died 5 months later while she was doing school work at her desk on May 26. Have emailed Hugo express and Acer support. We will see what happens.	3	1	0	0	2

Bought this for my uncle you can't tell it's refurbished at all. It's very sleek and it's exactly what he will need so a really good buy and I got it very quickly because I'm an Amazon Prime member. Being a Amazon Prime member is worth the money	3	1	0	0	2

There is nothing wrong with the service, I love getting used tech for cheaper, I just knew that this was going to be a cheap Chromebook that I needed right this second. But it is so slow! It's killing me. I will probably buy another used laptop when I have money. I just hope I don't throw this hunk of junk before than.	3	1	0	0	2

First off, I read all the reviews. Some were good, some were bad. I thought that there were more good then bad so I decided to buy this. WORST MISTAKE EVER! The camera is busted. The “refurbished” is broken. They didn’t fix it right. I contacted the seller, and as you can guess, IM STUCK WITH THIS AND NOW HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW LAPTOP. People don’t care about warranties on their products	3	1	0	0	2

I bought this for my children to use for their internet-based homework. I haven’t been able to turn it on yet because it did NOT include a power cord.

It's fine for work and light browsing of the internet. However, it is incredibly slow and often freezes when multiple tabs or open or you're watching Youtube or Netflix videos. Also chromebook is not the best OS as you cannot download certain things such as Steam, and it basically requires you to use Chrome or else it's useless.	3	1	0	0	2

I purchased this Chromebook for online classes primarily. I already utilized google apps and programs prior when I had an android phone. You can't download any kind of software or anything to it, which is why there's so little space on the hard drive. It's not necessary. You do get up to 100GB of storage space on your google drive for a year or two though. For school purposes, I use Office Online since I can't download the actual software to the computer, and it works pretty much just the same. I also use it for facebook, email, shopping, etc.. It can definitely be a tiny bit slow if you're trying to look at a ton of stuff at once. I had to disable the autoplay on my facebook so it doesn't play the videos automatically and slow it down. But all in all, this does exactly what I purchased it for. I have a regular laptop if I need any additional processing power or storage space.The laptop may be refurbished, but it came in perfect condition. No scratches or dents, and no issues with the way it runs at all.	3	1	0	0	2

"Wow, after 30+ years in the IT development and support industry, I found building a Linux kernel, and building a laptop from scratch easier than figuring out how to set a passphrase in Chrome. The Chrome help is a nightmare, and I think operating system and general google changes invalidates most of the advice that one can find online. I am pretty frustrated. Sound worked out of the box, but then, by waving my hand or something, it stopped working. Also sync won't work, and I can find no way to put in a ""passhrase"". All the ""helps"" are not helpful, because the Icons, words or whatever ""they"" say to click on, AREN' THERE! (software changes?)Unless you have more patience than Job, or nothing else to do for a month or so. don't try a chromebook."	3	1	0	0	2

got laptop march 1,2018.laptop inoperable may5,2018. I contacted acer refurb center by phone ,experience like calling Social Security office,after long hold I was instructed to leave message .Almost 2 weeks now and no response from Acer. Amazon should not do buisiness with unreliable companies like them. Thinking about cancelling Amazon subscription.Have paid over $200,for laptop with extended warranty,and got no service at all.I purchased Dell laptop from Amazon 3 years ago still works perfect,except for weak battery.I AM forced to use old laptop.	3	1	0	0	2

We purchased 3 of these for our company and couldn't be happier. We have a web based training program for some of our employees and these fit the bill perfectly. They are surprisingly fast and easy to use. And, because they are all tied to one google account, when we make changes to one, the changes are reflected on the others. A great product at a great price!	3	1	0	0	2

I figured for $200 it wouldn’t be great but what I didn’t predict was it barely works. Drops internet during any download, can only store 1 movie and the drive becomes “critically low” and most web pages stutter. This includes trying to use google documents which means typing a page stutters so much it’s not possible to use. I returned after a couple days.	3	1	0	0	2
It's good, not what I was looking for, I could not hook up my printer to it.	3	1	0	0	2
I bought this a month ago thinking it would solve our computing problems. It doesn't. Our printer works with our other computer. It will not work with the Chromebook. I downloaded 2 apps and they loaded. I downloaded 4 more apps and they are not there. I called Acer and they said it is a common problem but I have to pay to fix it. I expected a computer that works well . This is not it.	3	1	0	0	2
Nice chromebook does surfing, bills ect in snap and the bigger monitor is a +. My biggest complaint is the weight it feels like a regular laptop with all the hardware and the micro SD card doesn't insert all the way only half so you don't really want to. Store it with the card. Other than that it's working good for the price it's a nice addition to my electronics.	3	1	0	0	2

Chromebook is good for kids but, if you're a person that does a lot more than just surf the net, it'll drive you crazy. It has nothing that it should (basic network printing options, Adobe, etc.). It's a cool concept, a pretty fast as far as laptops go. But not for the 35 & up crowd	3	1	0	0	2

Before I wrote down this review, I have used this laptop 3 weeks. Acer's Chromebook 14 has a few things to brag about: Its brushed-aluminum chassis and high-resolution display make it stand out among other affordable models, even if other features remain pretty basic.	3	1	0	0	2

My previous Chrome book was an HP and a little smaller, but so much faster. This one boasted being fast, but it lags quite a bit. I checked my wifi connection and even made sure I had all the updates. This is a nice looking computer, but nice looking does not make it more functional. I am not returning it, but may find some other way to speed it up.	3	1	0	0	2

The computer is pretty intuitive but does have some features that I am not used to or should I say don't like, Caps being the main one, I touch type and automatically default to the caps key when capitalizing letters at the being of a sentence, on this model I have to hit the alt and magnifying key at the same time, not sure why they did this but its a pain in the backside so not sure if I will use it that much	3	1	0	0	2

Chrome browser in a box. If that is what you need excellent. Think of the most locked up useless tablet you can find. That tablet is more useful then a chromebook or a chromebox. Get a keyboard and monitor for your smart phone and you get a better system. If it can run in or on a chrome web browser then it probably run on a chromebook. If can not run on a chrome browser then it can not run on a chromebook.	3	1	0	0	2

I've only had it for about 3 weeks. Here are some things I love: The price can't beat it, it didn't even seem Refurbished. The chrome OS does all I need to do, the FAST on/off awesome compared to my windows desktop. unit is very sturdy I don't know what other posters were saying about cheap feeling, The speakers are very good for a laptop let alone at this price. .Here are the things I don't like but none are deal breaker as I was not expecting a 499.00 laptop comparison: The screen is not the best but better then I thought but again not spending 500$. The keyboard a learning curve but after awhile no prob, a bit slow sometimes works fine in youtube, Netflix , periscope forget it, works but just not enough power under the hood. Over all it was/is a great choice for me.	3	1	0	0	2

Exceptional laptop. With that 8th gen Core i5, it's such a pleasure to use this for anything (heck, I was playing a freaking 8K video and a 4K video at the same time and it still wouldn't drop frames), all while battery life is absolutely great. The chassis is sturdy yet very light weight. Really not much to complain about. If you want a lightweight, premium, top performance ultrabook, this is the one to get.My only gripe was that the display seemed to have a bit of green tint, very noticeable when compared to my phone's calibrated display or the Samsung Chromebook Pro I tried for a while, but lowering the Green contrast to 46 from 50 in Intel Graphics settings solved it. I also bumped the saturation just +5, and the screen looks gorgeous now–very similar to my small Pixel 2 which is very well calibrated. Only tip is to uninstall ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement Utility as it doesn't allow Intel Graphics Settings to stay after sleep or reboot for some reason, probably because both have calibration options and conflict with each other.With the display fixed, this thing is 10/10. Fan noise is actually very low or non existent in most tasks. Only when I put it under heavy load (like syncing 12,000 files on Google Backup & Sync) do you hear it and even then it's not annoying. And the touchpad does accidentally trigger 'double tap and drag' when you don't want to a few times, but honestly I usually disable 'double tap to drag' because I rarely drag and when I do, it's more natural to click and drag instead of double tapping.This is a great buy that will last you for a long time given the sturdy chassis and future-proof specs.	2	5	2	3	4
OK I love it. Have had it for three weeks. Lightening fast. 8th gen i5 and 256 SSD. I love the keyboard . Don't understand the complaint that the feel is too light. No problem with shutdown/restart that some people have reported. Still learning Windows 10, up from Windows 7 on old p.c. Would have liked a third USB port since I use a mouse (old school). Speaking of old school, I don't have a screen bleed problem with gaming or watching videos because, well, I don't do that. No ghosting. No buttons popping off keyboard. I have not yet accidentally turned it off because of the location of the power button where the delete button usually is. I am satisfied with the battery life though it is not 12 hours. But I bet I could get there if I spent some time checking what apps run at startup. recharges fast. It's quiet. It is not hot. So far, I have not had any of the problems recorded by the folks who scored this a 1. So take the chance. It's a really fast, very light, easy to use Zenbook if you simply want a good computer.Model: ASUS ZenBook Ultra-Slim Laptop, 13.3-inch Full HD, 8th gen Intel i5-8250U Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Backlit keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, Anti-Glare, Windows 10, Grey, UX330UA-AH55	2	5	2	3	4
Are you on a mid to high end budget? Trying to find a PC that's lightweight and small, without compromising power? Do you care little for 2-1 computers or touch screens? Then this laptop is for you.The specs on this little book are phenomenal. The main selling point for this computer is its 8th Gen Intel i5-8250U processor. The processor is monstrous for this price range. Its base speed of 1.6 GHz, means that your computer will be drawing as little power as possible for low demand tasks like word processing or internet browsing. But its turbo boost up to 3.4 GHz ensures that this laptop has power for more demanding tasks.Oh, and did I mention that this processor has FOUR CORES? Yes, that's right FOUR CORES. This is unusual at this price range, as many laptops on the market around $750 tend to have dual core processors instead. This laptop's processing power rivals, and some cases exceeds others around the $1,000 mark.The PC has enough RAM at 8 GB. Sufficient for most tasks the average consumer will face, and still enough for those looking for an edge. The 256 Solid State Drive provides a reasonable amount of storage. When combined with the processor on this PC, it boots up swiftly.Its battery is more than sufficient for all day use. If you find yourself running low on power, the charger itself is extremely lightweight, and in my experience the laptop is capable of charging around 50% of its battery to near full in about an hour.All of this performance doesn't even take into consideration that this laptop is a lightweight, coming in at 2.6 pounds. As a personal opinion, being able to pick up such a light computer knowing it packs FOUR CORES of power at this price range is an unparalleled high.This laptop is absolutely stellar.	2	5	2	3	4
I've only had this a week, but it's been a great week. I've used this laptop for writing reports, email, web browsing, minor photo editing, and wordpress development. It's worked perfectly for all of those tasks, with no slowdown that I've noticed at any time. Battery life is excellent, with around 10 hours of actual use, and very good standby battery life.The only issues I've had are 1) keyboard - the keys are just a bit . . . different. Sometimes I think that I hit a key, but it doesn't register. This mostly happens when I'm typing longer emails or I'm not paying as much attention. If I focus on my typing, it's not an issue. 2) Fan - the CPU fan comes on even during low intensity tasks like web browsing. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. I wish it were quieter, but it's really not a big deal. For how smooth everything runs, I gladly take the fan noise. And 3) the left USB port doesn't work with my wireless mouse. The right USB port works, and the left USB port works with everything else I've tried, including a USB hub and a thumb drive. Not sure what the issue is there, but I just use the right port.I would definitely buy it again, and I think it's a great device for the price.	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I needed something that was light, sturdy, portable, fast, and good on battery life.Build:This laptop is sturdy with hardly any flex to be found. The exterior of the laptop is metal and looks quite nice. The inside is a premium grade plastic. The laptop is extremely solid when closes and I have no worries throwing it into my backpack. It is extremely light and hardly noticeable on my back. The keyboard is surprisingly nice to use (I had expected it to be bad, but boy was I wrong).Screen: The 13 inch ultrabook screen size is perfect. I used to have a 17 inch display but I do not miss it after having the portability of the 13. I do not have any trouble reading the display. The display gets plenty bright for me in nearly every condition. It is sharp and just all around good looking.Battery: This batter lasts far longer than I ever expected it to. Even on the highest performance settings, I can expect it to last about 4 hours. By turning down the brightness of the keyboard and screen, I can get easily over 9 hours of continuous use of of this thing.Speed: Make sure to get the Intel 8th gen chip. Do not settle for the 7th gen or anything less. The 8th is at least a 40% improvement over the 7 and it shows. This thing is lightning fast. It holds many chrome tabs and programs with ease. I have absolutely no problems with the speed of this device (and I am very picky).Price: Anything cheaper than this will have a significant drop in reliability and build quality. You can get other laptops for cheaper, but I wouldn't. After examining many of its competitors (Dell XPS 13, HP Envy, etc.), I can truly say that this is the best value. Other well known ultrabooks do a fantastic job and may improve slightly over this device, but it will come at a much greater cost.Gaming: Extremely light gaming is doable on this laptop but that is definitely not it's intended purpose. If you expect this to be your main computer as a gamer, you should look elsewhere. Ultrabooks just aren't made for that. You will still need to invest in something with a dedicated graphics card and an i7. I use this laptop when I am away from my gaming desktop.	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop would be great if the monitor wasn't so terrible. I had backlight bleed watching movies no matter how I set the brightness or contrast. Two of these were defective. I sure hope they don't consider this bleeding acceptable. My 6 year old Asus it replaced has darker black and no spill and it was only about 400 dollars. Too bad. This thing loads fast, is light weight, has plenty of power for work and play, but it's just terrible for doing any work with night charts, movies or anything other than surfing web pages. One computer had problems bleeding from the top left corner, bottom right and center. This one has some bleeding from the bottom left and just right of center. It is distracting and annoying. Completely unacceptable in this day and age. Frustrating as all heck. Thankfully, Amazon customer service processed my rant and is taking good care of me.Honestly, I would not purchase an asus product again after this experience. Quality control is extremely important in technology.	2	5	2	3	4
Within a month, the plastic beveling around the screen started to peel off/unattach. I called ASUS support who are the absolute worst. Albeit, all computer customer services are terrible except for Apple. ASUS wanted me to ship back my laptop, at my expense, and wait 4 weeks to get it back. No thanks. Fortunately amazon is letting me return this. Way too dangerous to keep this laptop for the long term and see what other issues arise. Wirecutter needs to update their reviews and remove this cheaply made laptop. Go for Dell XPS 13 insteadBUYER BEWARE	2	5	2	3	4
Everything you would want in a laptop-lightweight-GREAT screen in my opinion (laptops have trouble having good screens)-long lasting battery charge-charges fast-SUPERB KEYBOARD....-Trackpad is just fine for me, others complain but I haven't had a problem. If anything it's great.-wide viewing angle FHD-Thin-Finger print reader-Good SSD (Nothing crazy but just good enough)-I can run SFV / RCT3 (Street Fighter V, 720p/low settings / Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, 1080p nearly maxed settings) both at 60fps+ with the right settings. (Gaming)-great resolution screen, super clear once you set everything up-No real junkware on here, everything like ASUS Hello (gives free dropbox 12 month for 30gbs), sets up your warranty / acc. to ASUS Splendid (screen), that Vivid option is great.-Super good for price (Performance to price ratio)-Has auto brightness, but I turned my option off but it has a sensor for darkness / brightness of the screen-Dual mic for better qualitySometimes I even turn *down* the screen because it's too bright at times. Currently my screen writing this review is on 33%.neutral:-power button is near backspace. I have no problem with it.. I'm too muscle memory to press random buttons but I can see how beginners / non-tech savy / or butterfingers can press it by accidentcon:-Bad webcam. If you need a webcam, buy an external and still get the laptop!! Gladly, I don't use a webcam.Hit me up under this thread if you want to know something specific.	2	5	2	3	4
Very nice ultrabook.Pluses:The startup is fast in about 5-6 secs. The fingerprint scanner is responsive also.SSD performs quite well.Screen is very sharp (not incredibly bright). Not sure what it'd be like in sunlight.Touch pad is very accurate and responsive.Minuses:-No dedicated Insert key (might not be a big deal to most people but for someone who uses Shift-Ins for paste. It's a difficult adjustment to have to hit the Shift-Fn-delete to insert.-The keyboard isn't the best but not bad either. Keys not hit perfectly sometimes lead to missed letters. It's fine for a laptop keyboard though.-Not expandable for memory and SSD	2	5	2	3	4
PROS:1. This is my third Asus - all are still working, just old. I've been pleased with reliability, performance, and battery life on all - and especially this one.2. Very light.3. Fast.4. Good screen size for small laptop.CONS:1. Power button is upper right - where you expact to hit the delete key. (Delete key is to left of it) I had to put a cardboard flap over the power button since every time I went to delete I turned off the PC.2. I like having discrete Home, Page Up/Down, End keys - but it is okay to use CTRL and the arrow keys for that - just took a minute to get used to.OTHER:1. Was a little hard to get used to the keyboard, the keys felt a little far apart - like I needed bigger hands. But after a couple of days, no problems.2. Not a big fan of Windows 10, extra clicks to get most basic tasks done. OneNote does not work properly with it. But that is not Asus' fault.3. I thought the screen was too dim and was a complaint - but then realized that I needed to change the power settings. Now the screen is nice and bright.4. Fan is only loud-ish when doing virus scans or something intensive, otherwise very quiet.	2	5	2	3	4
So far so good.I had a Lenovo Idea laptop for 6 years .It was fanatastic ,never broke down ,but is running slow now.And is so heavy.The Asus is so light 2.6lbs versus 4.7lbs.It boots in seconds,is fast,great picture on screen.If it holds up im going to really like it.Some reviews scared me .Noisy fan ,can't hear the fan at all.So do I have any complaints ? Well yes ,not serious ones .Too few USB's only 2 ,I always had 3 and miss the extra one.The keys are ok ,only ok ,not excited about them.Also I thought the keyboard was backlit,well ttheyr'e not..Despite those negatives ,I think I will really love this computer .I think you will too.I'm glad I waited for the 8th generation ,it's great.1/14/2018 :After using this for a couple of weeks ,I have simmered down a bit.First I wish the screen was a little sharper and being a small screen it gets a little hard to read the lettering.I also notice that the sound while ok ,is not too great.I'm comparing this Zen to a Lenovo ideapad which is 6 or 7 years old,much sharper, better sound ,but almost twice as heavy.I notice it is (kinda) backlit ,again not as well backlit as the Lenovo .I will say the Lenovo cost $200 more than the Zen.What I appreciate most is the 7 second boot time and the long battery life.2/2/2018An update.I got a scare a week ago.I got a black screen ,it wouldn't boot.I kept trying turning of and on for an hour.Eventually it started to work again.I did a restore point.The only problem with buying a computer online is ,it's not easy to return.Prices are better on Amazon but unlike Best Buy you can't drive and return it.Food for thought.	2	5	2	3	4
This is really my backup/travel computer. I have a high-end model that I do not like to take on the road. I purchased this model to fill in that gap. It has virtually everything I need. Backlit. Light. Good graphics. I don't game with it, so I can't speak to gaming. I only gave it 4 stars for a couple of reasons. 1) The on-off key is located on the upper right of the keyboard, right next to the DELETE key. I can't say how many times I've gone to delete something and accidentally turned off the machine. 2) The ARROW keys are in a funky arrangement, and they are inappropriately sized.All in all though, I like the machine. Since I keep everything on a cloud anyway, I'm not too concerned if this dies. But it's been very reliable. It starts incredibly fast. Some features are much better than my Yoga. No touch-screen though. But that would have added some serious $$ to the price.	2	5	2	3	4
A couple days ago first one came in an unopened clean box. Laptop was clean and untouched. It was flawless! I was so happy after TEN years with my good old 5.8 lb VAIO, which I'm writing this review on. Everything was great and laptop was so smooth, fast, lightweight, it has awesome track pad sensitivity and feeling (contrary to reviews I've seen) and a beautiful design, BUT... There was an incredible buzzing noise whenever I scroll down/up. I'm not sure if it was coming from the fan or something, but it sounded like it'd be a serious problem in a foreseeable future. I've returned it. The second one came today. Product box was already opened (black tape with ASUS logo on it was cut) and it was really disappointing. Still, I kept going to see if it were acceptable or not. There were fingerprints everywhere, a scratch on the screen and another one on the case. Annoying white dust stuck between the bottom side of the screen and the bezel (I don't know how did they manage to do that because there is almost no even any space between the screen and the bezel!). And lastly, Windows 10 installing guide was different than the first one. It was weird/clipped and made me uncomfortable. Frustrated, I've returned that too and got a refund. I'll probably wait a little before I order another one or look for a different laptop. I'm so sorry about all this because it's a beautifully designed and really fast laptop -according to my 2 day experience with the first one-...	2	5	2	3	4
"This laptop replaced an older 11"" Asus VivoBook, which had served us well for years but was getting doggy. This laptop Is a great travel/around-the-house/light office work model. Form factor is fantastic, THIN, like WAFER THIN, and very light. Great case design and quality construction. Snappy as all get out: more than sufficient processing power from the i5 8250U chip, sufficient memory to support everyday activity, and SSD for quick boot and file access. No qualms about performance whatsoever. Keyboard and trackpad are good quality with snappy reaction. Screen is pretty good, although there is a little light bleed evident at the bottom and top bezels on boot-up. Not noticeable during operation, though. Integrated graphics are fine for typical Windows operations and video rendering, but not recommend this laptop for any sort of demanding applications or gaming."	2	5	2	3	4
I have had multiple issues with this laptop.1. The laptop refuses to balance on all 4 of its rubber feet which makes it extremely hard to balance it on any flat surface without experiencing significant screen wobble.2. The OS crashed and refused to do a complete system restore.3. Experienced terrible wi-fi issues (Public Network only) which turned out to be a driver issue that corrupted after Windows launched the Fall Creators Update4. Terrible fan rattling noise which definitely felt like there was something pushing against it.Overall I personally have had a very bad experience with the laptop and returned both the original and the replacement orders	2	5	2	3	4
The Asus Zenbook Ultra-Slim Laptop is everything I wanted.I purchased the 8th gen i5 core and is by far the best laptop I owned for such price.It's very slim, works super fast, and that touch-screen login is just AMAZING.The fan sometimes briefly makes a loud sound you're running too many apps, but that never bothered me.The battery time is by far impeccable. This thing lasts me 8-12 hours depending on the apps I'm using and the brightness setting.The screen is a bit flimsy and not as sturdy as most laptops (as in it kinda shakes when you move it around, but not to the point where it's a flaw in my opinion.)I'm just completely in love with its design and everything about it is delightful to me.	2	5	2	3	4
I have had this laptop for a little over a month now and am really happy with it. It is a good middle of the road laptop. It is light and slim which makes it great for traveling and working online.Pros:- Very light and portable but doesn't feel chintzy. It seems to be constructed well.-The i5 does pretty well. The onboard graphics will bottleneck in certain situations, though, I have only encountered this when gaming.-As just mentioned this will handle light gaming. I play Skyrim with medium settings and have good framerate any more than that and it will bog down. I was able to play overwatch as well but had to do a lot of fiddling with the graphics to get it to run smooth.-This is my first computer with an SSD and I love them. From the time you push power, you can be opening your web browser in 15 seconds. It also helps with the dreaded windows update. It takes SIGNIFICANTLY less time to update.-The harman/kardon speakers are great they have a good sound quality for a laptop speaker and are plenty loud.-The battery life is very good. It will stay charged for 5 or 6 hours while gaming while connected to the internet and full brightness. Essentially, you will have 5 to 6 hours of battery at the least. You can get at least 12 hours with light use.-A common complaint about this laptop is a loud fan. I haven't experienced this at all. Mine is very quiet and works well.- I use it for photo editing via lightroom and it does well.Cons:-The screen doesn't have a wide range of motion. It probably only goes to 100 degrees or so.-As I said you can do light gaming with this but if you a really into gaming and want to play with high settings this isn't for you.Overall this laptop is great for work a little above your typical internet streaming and word processing. This is probably the best value you will find before moving into the Ultrabook tier.	2	5	2	3	4
I really like this computer. The only thing that is a bit off for me is the keyboard is not great. sometimes I hit the key and it does not register. This is particularly frustrating when coding. It could be my typing but I don't have issues with other keyboards. Also, the touch pad is a little different to use. It's touch is a little off. All in all this is a really good buy.	2	5	2	3	4
I don't know why this has so many good reviews regarding the screen. I absolutely could not stand the matte screen with the rainbow shimmering effect, especially on white backgrounds. It gave me headaches just after a few minutes, so I knew I couldn't keep it. The backlight bleed was horrible on dark apps like Visual Studio Code, or photo editing tools that use a dark background. Uneven backlight just kills the usefulness for many workflows, too.Performance-wise, it was as you'd expect out of the 8th generation Core i5's. I was content with that aspect, and the hardware build was sufficiently nice for its price-point.I just wish that there were more reviews cautioning me about the display quality, or I would have never gone with this model. I went with an Dell Inspiron 7373 with similar specs for a hundred dollars less on sale, and I've been plenty happy with the screen on that model instead.	2	5	2	3	4
I am so inlove with this laptop. When I got it I felt like a kid with christmas gift. It is very light, what I am still admiring, and the size perfectly fits my smaller backpack, so I can carry it with myself whenever I need. It is really very fast, its almost have no sound ( if I want to hear, I have to stop what I am doing and try to listen) and I love the keyboard, which makes very smooth writting feeling. I really like that the screen has eye-saving mode, so it will not get tired. And the battery last for about 6-7 hours without charging. I am still enjoying to work with it.	2	5	2	3	4
I don't know where you can get so much power in so sleek-cool package for the price. Hits the ground running with software set-up. Start to deployable for use in about and hour. Windows 10 and Office 365 comes preloaded saving hours of download (yea!)... just add accounts and passwords. Seamless link to existing wireless hardware and drivers.I've purchased 3 ZenBooks. This edition is better integrated with Windows for ease of set-up. I appreciate ASUS's cutting the bloat-ware load.Great value for money. No cons.	2	5	2	3	4
This is the worst laptop I’ve ever had in my life. My wireless connection was too slow, so I updated the wireless driver and got this resolved. But the battery driver stopped working and now it’s not detected by the OS. The laptop doesn’t turn on without the AC adapter. Already tried to reinstall Windows but didn’t worked as well. And I can’t send it back to amazon because I live in another country. Also, ASUS global warranty assistance does not work in my country Brazil. I bought this laptop a month ago. I’ve been saving money for a laptop for 2 years and now my brand new laptop is broken and useless. I tried everything, since reinstalling official drivers, restoring from a previous point and reinstalling Windows. I can’t even describe my frustration.	2	5	2	3	4
I'm a computer science student so having a PORTABLE laptop is essential. I really made an investment in this because it's a lot more expensive than my original price point but this laptop has everything I needed.The laptop is slim and super light so it's extremely portable.The battery lasts for FOREVER. I took this to a hackathon and at one point I was away from my charger and it lasted in power save mode for at least 3-4 hours after it got below 25%. It would have lasted longer but I plugged it in as soon as I could.The screen is awesome. I noticed a lot of the reviews before I bought this complained about the screen being too dim but for me its perfect. It's not extremely bright which really saves your eyes if you're up until midnight writing some code :^)Also, the i5 8th gen processor makes this laptop worth every penny.	2	5	2	3	4
Packaging was fine and the box was neat with no dents. When I saw the item I was so excited. Unfortunately when I turned on the laptop, it was glitching out from the start. The audio was fine too. I was so disappointed. The look and feel of the laptop is great. Will be returning and ordering a replacement.	2	5	2	3	4
I really liked this laptop HOWEVER I want every prospective buyer to know that USB-C port of this laptop does not support any video output thus it does not recognize any usb-c to HDMI converters. I have tried an apple converter and another (UGReen) converter , it does not recognize the HDMI video output.... ASUS should have mentioned this clear.USB-C to ethernet is recognized through the port..Now i have to buy separate cables.. I wish ASUS would have put a full HDMI port.	2	5	2	3	4
I really wanted to like this computer. And I did, except that the battery didn't work. It's fast and has a nice keyboard and display. It's very light weight and attractive. Mine apparently had a defective battery that wouldn't charge, and the OS reported 'No battery installed.' I returned it. Amazon was very good about the return.	2	5	2	3	4
"The performance of this laptop is great, but the level of pressure for the ""e"" key is much greater than the forc required to press other keys, which makes it annoying when I'm typing because I'll often press the ""e"" key too lightly for it to register when that amount of force would be fine on any other key (this is a mechanical issue). This fairly little problem causes me to have to retype a lot of words, and it is the only problem I have with it, although I bet it's just a problem with my specific laptop. If this didn't occur I'd give it 5 stars. I might return it to get the same model."	2	5	2	3	4
So good I just bought another one. Fast, light, bright sharp screen, SSD makes boot up just a few seconds. Thin and great battery life averaging 8-10 hours of use between charges. That's about once every 3-4 days of casual use for me. The only improvement I can think of is to make the keys a little more curved instead of flat. But other than that, it's a perfect laptop. Does not come with a huge amount of bloatware that needs to be removed. The speakers are not too bad either.The Dell XPS 13 may be better but at $1300 compared to this one at $750, this one is a much better value.	2	5	2	3	4
Got this laptop for computer science courseWas skeptical about this laptop but im so glad i got it!Zero problems like coil whine etc, for some reason i love the look including the bezel, and actually think it looks much better than the ux430 (my friend has it), performance is great with the 8th gen cpu. I was concernced with the slow ssd but its perfectly adequate!Overall great laptop at a great price	2	5	2	3	4
This is a great laptop and I would give it 5 stars except for one thing. I do wish ASUS had not installed Mcafee. It is part of the system and automatically reminds you to renew once your 'trial' subscription has ended. You can decline but you will continue to get reminders to renew several times a day and this is very annoying. I have tried to find ways to stop this even removing Mcafee from the system and going to there site to see what I can do about it so far no luck	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop is fantastic. Light, with an aluminum shell. The keyboard has a little give, but that is pretty similar to my previous laptop and chromebook. The laptop moves quickly, the screen is bright and crisp, stays connected to the internet. Gaming is pretty limited as this isn't a gaming laptop but the intel hd 620 chipset handles 3d images with no problem and modern games can be played with a bit of tweaking.	2	5	2	3	4
As a Mac lover, I need a Windows machine to take care some tasks. The ASUS ZenBook does the trick. I am sorry the RAM cannot be increased. The boot-up time is an impressive 25 seconds and handles apps like Dropbox well. I am particularly impressed with the responsive track pad compared to my older Windows machine made in 2014. All in all, great pick for the price.	2	5	2	3	4
I received my asus zenbook ux330ua today and was so excited to begin working on it. However, I immediately noticed how dark the screen is and even when I adjust the screen brightness to the highest setting, it is still very dark. I was very disappointed about this. I have attached a picture to show a comparison between the screen brightness of a hp laptop and the asus I just received.	2	5	2	3	4
Very satisfied. On line very helpful on setting up. Took over my computer and helped set it up. Perfect for my use. Of course there will always be something better value coming on the market, but was good value at the time I bought it without having to pay a fortune. Like everything except that the mouse seems very sensitive and I prefer an external mouse. Also I am not sure that the battery lasts as long as is advertised, but long enogh for my purpose.	2	5	2	3	4
Stable, fast, well designed. Average sound but very good monitor. This is a better alternative to Dell which I use for work, it’s really a great buy at this price too, I like it so much I ended up buying two.	2	5	2	3	4
This thing is tiny. It weighs so little I went to lift it up thinking it would be as heavy as my old one and it nearly flew out of my hands because it's so light. It's powerful, and connects to my external drives easily.	2	5	2	3	4
Excellent value, super thin and light almost everything work very well including the touchpad (saw reviews that it was stiff but my family is fine with it). The only thing that could be a bit better is the quality of the IPS screen. I would have paid +$50 for a better monitor. But totally do not regret the purchase and would probably buy it again.	2	5	2	3	4
"the bluetooth has is stopped two times working after 5 or 6 hours of use, it appears ""Unknown device (code 43)"" on the device manager. Looks like the module is afected by the heat, because it works again when I turn off the laptop and wait around for an hour. That's too bad, means a direct hardware problem."	2	5	2	3	4
I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement. I hope I can update my review with a better score when I get the replacement,=== Update ===I got a replacement. The new one looks okay. At least, there are no big gaps or exposed wires.	2	5	2	3	4
I received my new laptop a few weeks ago and must say I love my ZenBook! Super light, super thin, and super fast! I was worried I would have a lot of bloatware (as my Dell came with) but besides a couple of games I could easily delete, it was just right! The fingerprint scanner is nice, but not as good as an iPhone. It doesn’t always read accurately-not a big enough problem to doc a rating from. Overall very pleased.	2	5	2	3	4
At first it was all okay but after some usage, the metal screen frame started to levitate from bottom and made hard to open the computer. I have sent to ASUS for repair, received now but nothing seems changed. I think the product is defective or it is second-quality. I don't recommend this product. Additionally, it is so hard to get your problem solved by the actual people who can help in terms of replacement or refund.	2	5	2	3	4
I bought this for my son in January. The charge lasts the entire day at school, and I know that it is not all used for educational purposes.The display is very matt and gives the impression of not being sharp, but in fact it is quite ok and it proves very useful in bright environments, and you get no reflection.The keyboard is quite good and feels nice.It doesn't produce noise (except when under a lot of pressure mainly during updates and heavy graphics usage).The ports are great and useful.The storage and memory are also at the sweep spot, and well balanced.So overall extremely happy, given that the price difference here in australia for a similar spec would be around the $500.	2	5	2	3	4
I needed a laptop that could withstand travel. I like the solid state hard drive, the slim profile and the matte screen. I have a second laptop that is my photography processing workhorse that never leaves my office so I did not need a lot of hard drive space or RAM. I use this laptop for internet research/shopping and writing. I am very happy with my purchase.	2	5	2	3	4
I received it 2 weeks ago and so far so good.Just a few notes for the potential buyers and the one who are still not sure whether to purchase it or not.1- Out of the box every thing was fine, but the WiFi download speed. It was terrible and I were sure something is wrong. I normally have around 50 Mbps download and around 100 Mbps upload speed. However, with this laptop it was around 1 Mbps download and almost 100 Mbps upload speed. I searched the web, but there were some wrong info. I reinstalled windows, updated WiFi driver through device manager but it was not the solution. The only solution was to update the Windows to the latest version (Windows 10 Fall Creators Update) and afterward upgrading the WiFi driver via the Intel's website (I mean downloading the driver from intel's website not the device manager). Now every thing is fine and the download and upload speed are as they should be.2- Besides the above mentioned issue, the most important issue, is the fan noise. I mean it starts working when you don't believe it is necessary and makes of course noise. I haven't checked the CPU temperature, but I found the cooling fan active when I was downloading a bis software package and installing some others which I believe is not that much. However, it seems it's due to the thickness of the laptop and it gets warm very quick.3- Last but not least, although the production quality is fine enough, the casing material (The Aluminium alloy I think) is not that great. You can easily feel the difference with a high-end laptop body like Apple MacBooks. However, that's not bad at all, it's just not premium.For the best parts, I would choose first the weight. You can't imagine how thin and light is that. Furthermore, the battery last for almost the whole day and you can be sure that you won't get out of charge through the day. Although ASUS claims 12 hours, for the mixes tasks like internet browsing, movie watching, some office works and general university stuff, you can be sure to have at least 8 hours of charge.All in all, I rate this great machine 5 star, since price-wise it's even more than the best. You get the latest Intel Core i5 together with 8GB RAM and 256 SSD in s very thin and light body just for 750$. That's great and I am satisfied till now.	2	5	2	3	4
So far, so good. Great form factor and fast. Not too much bloatware, just uninstall McAfee crap. The screen looks good and the flat (non glossy) finish works well for clarity and wide angle of viewing. I travel often and replaced a 6 year old Acer ultrabook at about the same pricepoint. Since Acer isn't a high end brand, I hope to get similar long life out of this one. I'll update if it doesn't perform as expected.	2	5	2	3	4
Product was as described. I bought from Amazon. This is the 8gb 256gbssd 13in fhd asus ux330ua-ah55 8th gen intel core i5 processor.Laptop is thin, light, and fast enough for daily use. Build is very sturdy, very nice aluminum body. Ordered last Nov23, 2017 and recieved on Nov 28.I love the FHD antiglare display and matte screen. The fingerprint sensor works very well for me. It has enough ports for me, the SD card sticks out when plugged in as seen in the picture.The fans turn on with moderate tasks such as video editing and photoshop, but it is not that loud to me.Keyboard is backlit and takes a little getting used to due to shorter key travel compared from my older laptop.The trackpad is just ok, it is not the best. I dont use the web camera so I cant say anything for it.Sounds on this laptop has good quality, I can hear a little bass and it is loud enough to fill the living room and can be heard outside the house.Battery life so far lasts about 8 to 10hours. Laptop is for mobility.This laptop is great for me and I would recommend it. Worth it for its price.ASUS ZenBook Ultra-Slim Laptop, 13.3-inch Full HD, 8th gen Intel i5-8250U Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Backlit keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, Anti-Glare, Windows 10, Grey, UX330UA-AH55	2	5	2	3	4
Excellent value for money, thin, slim and beautifully designed, as for the specs latest gen core i5 processor and 8 gb of RAM are more than enough for everyday taks and even light gaming and video editing. The keyboard feels really good but not as good as a Macbook if you are upgrading from one of those as is my case, the screen is decent but probably the least quality item from the pack. Mine came with 3 dead pixels but it was impossible to return it since I brought it to my home country in South America and I found out it doesn't have international warranty, so this is something you need to carefully consider if you live outside the US.	2	5	2	3	4
Wow! Great laptop. Amazing speed, lit keyboard and 10 hour battery. Slim and lightweight. Fingerprint access, which works MOST of the time. Rest of he time, use a PIN or your password. Very pleased with this laptop.	2	5	2	3	4
Not a tech kinda person. I just wanted a laptop for uni that would be able to use word and PowerPoint and let me watch my lecture videos. Well, it’s fantastic. Nice and lightweight, thin, sleek and works really well. The best part is that the battery lasts for ages! I use my laptop every day for uni (~6 hours a day maybe more or less depending on the day) and I’ll charge it probably 4 times a week! Love this laptop, definitely recommend!	2	5	2	3	4
"Best bang for the buck at the technology level required for comfortable use. If someone says ""I need a good laptop, nothing fancy, but I don't want any significant compromises"" - this is the one to get."	2	5	2	3	4
Simple and quick setup. No software or function issues. With that said there was a small damage on the back of the laptop display. The smooth metal finish is aesthetically pleasing but the multiple imperfection show up quite easily. This does affect the overall perception of the product, which seem to have flaws in the manufacturing process. There were no issues with the packaging however.	2	5	2	3	4
Love the size of this computer, but it takes an act of God to get the keyboard to work with any degree of ease.	2	5	2	3	4
Exactly what I needed, slick and hearty. There are other reviews that complain of fan noise: I can tell when the fan is on, but it's not super noticeable. I'm not sure if my unit is just soft spoken or if the people complaining of fan noise are super sensitive. Track pad works great, fingerprint reader is a nice feature. All in all, a really good unit.	2	5	2	3	4
Something is very wrong with the wireless adapter. I contacted customer service at Asus multiple times and have not received the help I need.	2	5	2	3	4
The sensitive area of the touchpad overlaps the left and right mouse buttons. The designers must have eaten too many Tide Pods. Seriously ... why would anyone cover buttons on a keyboard with the touchpad?	2	5	2	3	4
Amazing ultrabook. I purchased mine refurbished and besides some faint scratching on the hinge, everything is perfect. Stellar battery life and performance. Fingerprint sensor is nice. Back-lit keyboard and screen are all very bright. Only wish they would include a micro HDMI to HDMI adapter in the box.	2	5	2	3	4
All good. Great laptop. perfect size and decent battery life. Exactly what I needed. My only problem is that the fan sometimes makes some noise and gets heated up pretty fast, and it's just my second day! It would make some noise for a few mins and then go back to normal. I'm just pretty concerned that it's only my second day of using it..	2	5	2	3	4
This is now my main machine, I got this on a warehouse deal and could not be happier. The keyboard backlight, battery life, power, everything has been spectacular.	2	5	2	3	4
This replaces the mac air in weight. I enjoy it very much. As I seem to be more of a Windows user, then a Max user.	2	5	2	3	4
Very disappointed with this device. I loved it at first but appears the hinge that connects the top to the keyboard is very cheap and easily torn. It also freezes completely on occasion and not sure what causes this problem. I am sending it in to be repaired and may request a refund.	2	5	2	3	4
This is a slick little laptop, especially for the money. The processor flies and the slim size and light weight make it SUCH an improvement over my old balky Dell. The comments in the trade press and here about the track pad are true - its definitely the weak link in the hardware. But I'm getting used to it gradually. For not much money they could make this SO much better with a better pad.	2	5	2	3	4
the mouse is almost completely unresponsive and makes scrolling or browsing (the main purpose of this laptop) nearly impossible. I am not picky but this is unusable! Do not buy this laptop! I am out of the 30 day return policy otherwise I would return this asap!	2	5	2	3	4
Super slim and light perfect for backpack to school. Nice screen. Windows version of MacBook Air	2	5	2	3	4
This is an awesome laptop for working and light gaming! A few things that may annoy people: fans do get a bit loud even if if you are not doing heavy stuff like watching Netflix or Twitch, screen is not at best at the light of a sunny day but it's not bad! Overall easily best laptop for the money that you can get in this price range.	2	5	2	3	4
thin and slicenice laptop for student who take it out everydaystrong performance with core 8 th gen cpukeyboard with automatic backlitbut...LDDR3 memory come on it is 2018 Asus.. why not get ddr4?the edge of screen is too thick for a 2017 portable laptop otherwise it could make to 14inch display with its size	2	5	2	3	4
Was an OK computer, but ordered the more expensive model, which was worth the extra $100	2	5	2	3	4
I never could get it to turn on, even after 6 hours of charging. Sent it back, and haven't had the nerve to replace it yet.	2	5	2	3	4
This is the best laptop I have ever owned, albeit I've only owned one before this, it was made to run windows. The internal hard drive makes everything better, and it looks chic to display.	2	5	2	3	4
Great laptop. Great lightweight computer for commuting. Works as advertised. Excellent battery life ( I can get 10 hours with battery saver on sometimes). My only complaint is that the trackpad is kind of crappy. You get used to it after awhile, but it can be a little wonky. Everything else works great.	2	5	2	3	4
The laptop is gorgeous. A bit smaller than expected. This is a dim computer, so if you are looking for a bright display, this is not it. Also, the video pixelates and are blurry. I am returning it for these reasons.	2	5	2	3	4
I've been using this computer for 5 months now and I absolutely love it! It's fast and easy to use. So light and comfortable to carry around. Exactly what I wanted!	2	5	2	3	4
I would say that I will recommend this computer especially for college students! It’s an overall 5 stars! From shipping, packaging to quality and performance.	2	5	2	3	4
Great computer for the price	2	5	2	3	4
My husband and I are not very tech savy people, but we really like our ZenBook. It is very lightweight and very fast.	2	5	2	3	4
I got this laptop for the purpose of college/graduate school, and am so far highly satisfied with the laptop. It is incredibly light and thin, and runs very quickly! It is a very compact size, has a very sharp display, and is very affordable. Would definitely recommend this laptop to any college student!	2	5	2	3	4
Still setting things up. . . . .this thing is lightening fast. Keep hitting the power button instead of delete though!	2	5	2	3	4
This laptop may not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive computers do, but it gets the job done at a more reasonable price. It is very quiet while operating and is super lightweight and portable. Meets all the basic needs of a student.	2	5	2	3	4
Excelent laptop for the price, buy with the i5 core 8th generation.	2	5	2	3	4
"really fast. light.Awkward placement of ""delete"" button."	2	5	2	3	4
The first thing I noticed after turning it on for the first time were bright spots around the perimeter of the screen but mostly at the bottom. Not a big deal when on the web but when watching watching a movie and the background became dark, it was annoying. See the photo.I heard good things about Asus customer support which is one of the main reasons I got the computer. I let them know about the problem and they responded once asking if I dropped it to which I told them no and then never heard back even after a couple more attempts. At that point I initiated a return with Amazon who of course was great.The aluminum body is nice but I was not impressed with the build quality because it has a lot of flex to it. Overall it felt cheap.Anyway, glad a lot of people like the computer and I hate leaving anything less than a 5 star review but 3 stars in my case was more than generous.	2	5	2	3	4
Horrible. My computer gives me a blue screen that doesn’t go away unless I shut down the whole computer losing any work I didn’t save.Did attempt to remove and redownload Microsoft Offiice. But did not fix the issue.	2	5	2	3	4
The screen is a yellow tint and if you are not used to it as I was, it is annoying and the clarity seems bad. After a time, you do get used to it so that's great.	2	5	2	3	4
Arrived safe and sound.	2	5	2	3	4
Great laptop, light and easy to use. Still compatible with all the software I used for Window 7.	2	5	2	3	4
Very fast and light, great for internet browsing, casual gaming, music, ect. Not for intensive games.	2	5	2	3	4
This computer is super fast and works great. Nice battery life, and way better value than those overpriced MacBooks.	2	5	2	3	4
Great computer so far! Lightweight, streamline, works quickly, great screen. Very happy so far. I do wish the keys were slightly more raised, but I will get used to the new keyboard I am sure.	2	5	2	3	4
It has everything that I look for in a laptop. Excellent performance and battery life, fantastic set of connectivity options, high-quality keyboard and trackpad, lightweight body,	2	5	2	3	4
The best purchase in terms of computers. Sometimes it is a little noisy but the battery life and the light weight combined with it's practicality make it a wonderful choice.	2	5	2	3	4
Great laptop. Very useful.	2	5	2	3	4
In the middle of trying to resolve an issue with the laptop frequently losing WiFi internet connection whereas our other devices stay connected. Hopeful that we don’t have a lemon. Love the slim lightweight design.	2	5	2	3	4
Came with a wobbly base. Fan was also making a sharp sound at times - not sure if that's a big deal but the uneven base killed it for me.	2	5	2	3	4
Excellent value even with import tax, very fast, light and great quality. You will need a 2 to 3 pin adaptor for the UK and of course it’s got a US keyboard layout but that’s not really a problem.	2	5	2	3	4
I got this computer for college, and it is perfect for me. The only problem is the touchpad is very touchy. Other than that I am very happy I made this purchase.	2	5	2	3	4
The delivery was very quick without any damage to the laptop. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. Smooth interface and no lags. cheers to Amazon.	2	5	2	3	4
Love it. Hard to get used to the smaller size, but it is perfect for school since I have to carry it around with me.	2	5	2	3	4
Runs smoothly and works good for starting photography.	2	5	2	3	4
I love this laptop, perfect laptop for my college use. I love the matte screen, it's not glossy so there is no glare. It's super thin and portable.	2	5	2	3	4
If you're looking for a light laptop, for school that can do basic workload and a little more. This is the one for you. Glad I purchased this!	2	5	2	3	4
Awesome service delivery timed perfectly, brilliant product - have spent much time enjoying the features of this lightweight machine.	2	5	2	3	4
Just got this computer 3 days ago.. it's blazing fast, feels solid and looks good.. the aluminum body gives it a premium feel and I love it..so far everything is working as it should.. battery seems to last a lot, but probably because i'm comparing to my 6 years old laptop that had only like an hour o so.. anyway, I'm very happy with my purchase and recommends to anyone looking for a new ultrabook..	2	5	2	3	4
Never regret buying it	2	5	2	3	4
Got exactly what I expected and performs flawlessly. The SSD makes a huge difference.The i5 compares to last gen's i7 at a fraction of the cost.	2	5	2	3	4
Loved the zenbook for its lightness and easy to carry. Good battery life. It will be better if ssd drive can can be higher capacity.	2	5	2	3	4
Overall is good, although the touch pad is a bit annoying when using it.	2	5	2	3	4
A laptop with good performance, very light! I liked it!	2	5	2	3	4
Im very stoked with my new computer. Light, fast, good battery and very nice look. Working good so far. Recommend.	2	5	2	3	4
Loving this laptop so far. The battery and screen are great. The sound is okay, as expected for a laptop of this size. The keyboard is a little weird however. I'm a pretty fast typer, and the short travel on the keys makes it a little difficult to type with. I swear I've never misspelled as much as I have with this keyboard. The wireless is super fast. The SSD makes for super quick loading, including bootups and shutdowns. The fingerprint reader is a MUST. I will never go back to a laptop without a fingerprint reader after having this computer. Overall, a great buy.	2	5	2	3	4
Outstanding device for the money....	2	5	2	3	4
Starts up quick, runs what I need for school effortlessly, and weighs next to nothing.	2	5	2	3	4

Amazing product. Great for all my home pc meeds and more.	2	5	2	3	4
great laptop, well worth it. no fan problems, great speakers, and beautiful screen.	2	5	2	3	4
Bought brand new. Display came with a stuck pixel (google it). Annoying for factory default/brand new. Battery is advertised as 12 hours all over. Realistically, it’s more like 5-8 with moderate usage.UPDATE - My battery was at 32% at the beginning of my evening class (6:30PM), and by 6:50 PM the laptop was at 3%, then died immediately after. The percentage shown is not accurate at all, and the battery life seems to be getting worse over time.	2	5	2	3	4
It's an amazing notebook. Very fast with an incredible design. Worth every cent.	2	5	2	3	4
Loud coil whine and Hugh fan speed seemingly at random but otherwise great laptop	2	5	2	3	4
You pay less and you get more... great buy...	2	5	2	3	4
I think this item has a great per dollar value	2	5	2	3	4
Amazing laptop at a great price!	2	5	2	3	4
Beautiful. Fast, lightweight. Does what it should do.	2	5	2	3	4
Very good laptop, I am fully satisfied.	2	5	2	3	4
Firstly, this laptop gets MAYBE 4 hours of battery life, which is 1/3 the advertised 12h. The ONLY programs I use are browsers, FTP, and Textpad, and I keep the battery settings dialed way down. Secondly, I've owned it for less than 4 months and the adapter just stopped working. And I take care of my equipment; it's not like I throw it around. I wish I'd stuck with Acer. Thirdly, when I attempted to contact Asus about getting a speedy replacement? Nothing. Crickets. No response via email, my Asus account, or twitter. Nice.Other than the poor service, poor battery life, and poor adapter quality, everything else was pretty nice.	2	5	2	3	4

I am a previous owner of a ASUS UX31A that I bought in mid 2013. It finally wore out, I liked it so bought this one as a replacement. Though it is fine there are a few unadvertised changes that irk me. First, this one does not open nearly as much as the UX31A. The UX31A would open almost 150 degrees, this one only to about 130 degrees. I have already run into operating situations where this I miss the old spec. For instance if the laptop is on a kitchen counter and you are standing to use it -- you really want that extra opening angle. Second, the UX31A power supply was made so the two prongs would fold back into the body of the power cube. This was great when you threw it into your carry case so the prongs would not poke into anything. Not so with this new one. They stick out and that's it. The UX31A came with a slip case. Not this one. Finally the speakers on the UX31A were on a bar in front of the function keys. On this one they come out the bottom of the case. Sound can be muffled. In my mind 3 poor design decisions and one just cheap cost saving measure. Now I am disappointed. If I had known these things I would have looked around some more before purchasing it.	2	5	2	3	4
"2 stars is ""I don't like it"", which is true. Its cheaply made. My first one had a issue with the sound, couldn't hear from internal speaker or through headphones. With this one, the frame for the screen has peeled off from the screen so now I gotta glue it together. Another issue is it sounds like there is a wire that is loose and is being hit by the fan. Also, it often runs very hot with just a browser open or Netflix running. I have to operate a Linux partition to avoid that last issue but there are somethings I must use Windows for. This is sad because my last Asus laptop was less expensive but ran much better than this. Best thing about this thing is the long battery life and nice display, but overall it's not worth it."	2	5	2	3	4
"Its fan is loud after a few months. One annoying thing is the ""McAfee LiveSafe"" subscription. I guess ASUS has a linked thing with the computer protection thing called "" McAfee Livesafe."" it expires after a few months and it pops up annoyingly. It forces you to pay for it. I mean I guess. I was hoping there was a windows firewall already or something? But really? lol.... Overall the laptop is fine. It reminds me of the Apple laptops. no bad. The fingerprint reader is nice too. Wish the speakers were on top but they are realy awesome. Idk i like it and i love it."	2	5	2	3	4
Battery DOA, the laptop wouldn't turn on, and when plugged in to a power adapter, didn't recognize the existence of a battery, the windows battery indicator said 0% available, plugged, in not charging!! Brand new, out of box laptop. Ordered a replacement, will see how that fares. Be warned.	2	5	2	3	4
Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Now she's got the best computer in the house. Fabulous picture and very fast. Only drawback is that Windows needs to work a little on their tablet mode interface.	2	5	2	3	4
I just got this computer so I won't say much here right now. But one thing I don't like is the promise of a 12 hour battery life. Mine can go from fully charged to dead in 6 hours. And it has taken 3 hours to fully charge up again. Not good.	2	5	2	3	4
Exactly what I was looking for! Plus, part of the proceeds go towards a great cause! If you pair that with amazon smile, then you’re donating to two causes with one purchase.	2	5	2	3	4
I receive yesterday, and despite the wonderful computer, speed and very light. the battery was not recognise by the computer. it means that I am returning back the computer. Hope the new one that I will get tomorrow can come correctly.	2	5	2	3	4
Ok, so I did major, major research on this puppy. Really, there isn't much else in the category that comes close to this price.Unfortunately, the Touchpad drivers (which I discovered have been a WELL KNOWN ISSUE for several years) were complete junk, and all it took was one Windows update to basically make the thing useless. In total, I spent probably about 8 hours trying to find a solution, but every time I restarted after brief periods of success, the Touchpad was dead again.Oh, did I mention no touchscreen? Yep. Just junky. I would add that I also discovered that ASUS has a wide variety of screen problems in everything from their tablets to this laptop. If your screen cracks internally, you'll be on the hook for it, no warranty. Final note on the screen: I can't believe how cheap and plastick-y it is. I felt like this was a laptop from 2005!Believe me, I SOOOO WANTED to love this laptop. But man... just absolute garbage. Save yourself a disaster.	2	5	2	3	4
Very good and good price	2	5	2	3	4
After a day of use, the screen has a yellow tint to it. It is terrible. This problem was not in any reviews but easily found when doing a search. I would not recommend this product.	2	5	2	3	4

"I like the laptop itself (although I never did get around to checking out the speakers, because of all the problems I had trying to set up the OS the way I wanted (can't be done), getting it to run the software I want to use & accept the file associations I wanted to set). Then there is the fact that Windows 10 is loaded with bloatware you can't uninstall or even disable, all kinds of subscription ""services"" that just cost you money--including the formerly free games like freecell & solitaire, it collects all kinds of information whether you want it to or not, which you can limit somewhat but not eliminate, & generally just insists on running your computer however it wants to regardless of anything you might want or need."	2	5	2	3	4

I have multiple ticket numbers. For some reason, they kept issuing me new ticket numbers for each reply it seems.Here are the few I could dig up.N180117529N180249415N1801139402N1801160374N1801160149N1801136813N1801139635N180335047Only after a couple months of buying a new ASUS ZenBook the touchpad begin failing.In the beginning of January, I filed a ticket to get it serviced due to a failing trackpad.I sent it in. First of all, it's ridiculous I had to pay for shipping but I can deal with that.I explained the problem in detail to support and even recorded a video of the issue. The laptop was sent back and the problem was not addressed. I contacted support and told them they did not fix the problem. I asked them what they did. They said they replaced the trackpad. I told them I had video evidence. They would not admit to this and offered to do another RMA.I agreed to send it in a second time. Again, they assured me it would be fixed. They said I would get priority support.I get it back and the trackpad doesn't click some of the time and now it's physically tilted. It's actually in worse condition. It actually took longer to get the laptop back this second time.I contact them again and asked just to get my money back. They said they cannot do this but said they would send me a replacement laptop. I agreed. This time, DAYS and DAYS go by and it's still in repair status. All they have to do is verify my laptop was received and send me a replacement I thought. I contact this nightmare of a support team and they say they are verifying my laptop has an issue. I ask to escalate the issue multiple time. I am assured it has been. I am now sitting on at least 3 days and have not heard back from a supervisor. They can't tell me who should be contacting me or when. The only thing I'm told is that the supervisor might not be in his office.I have lost countless hours and dollars having to use an old and slow laptop attempting to get things done.ASUS customer service is absolutely horrible.I have multiple ticket numbers. Here are just a few:N180117529N180249415N1801139402N1801160374N1801160149N1801136813N1801139635N180335047	2	5	2	3	4
This model has no touch screen and no tablet configuration	2	5	2	3	4
I own the UX330 (7th gen), and I love the battery life. I dual boot Ubuntu and run that as my main OS, and I routinely get 12 hours on it. I would highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't need a dedicated graphics card (photo/video editing, gaming) as the battery life is phenomenal.I try to charge it at around 40% and not past 80% to preserve battery life, so I only get about 5-6 hours SOT, but I'm only using 40% of the battery at a time. It charges quickly, 30 minutes or less to get that 40%, and I almost never turn it off, I just let it sleep. I can let it sleep for a couple days and if it drops 1% in that time I'm surprised.The screen angle is a bit annoying, I wish it would go back a bit further (15 degrees more would be great), but its light and it feels durable (not as nice as a macbook, but its half the price).I have had issues sometimes with the trackpad not responding properly, but I believe thats due to Ubuntu. It works wonderfully in Windows, I never have any issues typing in Windows and my hand usually rests on the trackpad, which caused problems with my previous laptop.The USB C is amazing for me, as my phone is USB C, it really makes life easy. Not as big of a plus if you don't have other usb c devices. The mini HDMI is annoying, I still haven't purchased any miniHDMI to HDMI cables.The speakers are in a terrible spot, underneath the laptop, and they're pretty underpowered. Again, in my mind, that would fall under a media machine, which this is not, so its not a deal breaker for me.My girlfriend purchased the 8th gen. It has a slightly more powerful processer, but less battery life. It still lasts a very long time, and she has no complaints.All in all, I love my laptop. Its unbelievably light, and the battery is awesome, and its more than quick enough for anything I use it for, as I don't do anything graphically intensive.	2	5	2	3	4
"I love this laptop. Coming from a triple-boot MacBook Pro 13"" 12,1 I was seriously doubting the ASUS would compete, but I actually like it better.First thing I did was shrink Windows 10 to install Linux on 1/2 the 256 GB SSD. Everything works great in Ubuntu 17.04, except for the fingerprint reader which is an ""unknown device"" in print and another driver I tried. I don't need the fingerprint reader to work, but it's been flawless everywhere else, and I am a Linux main (work tools).My only gripes could be that the sound is pretty quiet in Windows and though I can get over 100% in Linux it will distort past 100%. Another gripe would be the touchpad isn't as good as my previous MacBook, but that's not much of a surprise. Also the AC power supply is rather cheap, but I couldn't care less about that. If anything I like that I could probably get a generic replacement adapter at Walmart or Goodwill if I need one.The battery life of this ASUS is awesome- I don't need to charge it all day with regular usage. It's very light compared to my MacBook 13"". The keyboard is great and just as good as the Apple in my opinion. The screen is great at 1080p, the i5 eigth gen is fast, the disk is fast. This laptop is built well and does not feel as inexpensive as it is.I don't think there is a better laptop in this price range. Seriously check this one out if you need an ultralight!"	2	5	2	3	4
"I bought this since all of my apple products won't run Linux, and well I'm tired of Apple.Overall the build quality is nice for a $750 laptop. The i5 processor is fast enough to get things done (writing software/browsing/minor video editing). 8gb of ram is ""ok"", but it'd be lovely to have 16gb even if the cost was a bit more as the ram is not upgradable. The SSD is decent but there are faster drives out there, again for the price point not a big deal. 99% of your average consumers won't notice the IO difference between the onboard SSD and something more high end.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars was due to the fact I've had to return this model twice due to screen artifacts and bleeding. I'm not sure if I got 2 bad units in a 6 month span, but either way it's annoying. It's not extremely noticeable but when you're writing code, it can obscure your view.If the screen issues could be resolved, I'd buy another one in a second. Sadly, I'm going to look at other Linux-compatible laptops.Oh and Ps... if you are running Linux a couple of things.1.) Go for Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian as it is supported out of the box2.) If you want that gimmicky fingerprint reader to work, good luck with that lol"	2	5	2	3	4
I love this computer - lightweight, reasonable, great battery life - but the first one I got had a sticky key right out of the box. Amazon replaced it, but then my next computer has had a chronic track pad problem. Customer service has been helpful but after 2-3 times of being walked through the process of re-setting the driver they told me to do a full system re-set. Took a bunch of time and I had to pay to re-install some software, and then one week later the track pad cut out again. I'm preparing to send it in and at least shipping both ways is covered, but now I'm going to be without my computer for at least two weeks. The trackpad cutting out seems like an issue a couple other users have had based on these reviews, and seeing as it is a problem that presents itself a week or so after it starts working again, I'm really concerned about their ability to resolve this for the long haul. Fingers crossed sending it in works, but these two issues raise some concern for me about the basic quality. I made the switch since Apple laptops have gotten ridiculously expensive, but I have not had these basic quality issues with a brand new computer before. It's still a great computer, but does raise some concern.	2	5	2	3	4
I bought this laptop at the beginning of my college semester and i've had it for about 7 months now. It was working really well at first, but after a few months, it started to freeze up more often. Whenever it does, my mouse wouldn't move, any keys i press don't make a difference, and it also produces this strange sound. I would have to restart it every time but its happening more frequently now. As I am a colle student, its essential to have a laptop to use so I'm beginning to think of ditching it and getting a new one from a different brand.	2	5	2	3	4
You can't beat the styling, battery life and performance for the price.I got this while I was learning how to program for school.I've been doing some photoshop(GIMP) with it as well as Blender and haven't had a problem. I play HoTS and Hearthstone on it all the time, and some Minecraft(playing Project ozone Lite right now with my wife).Has trouble running WoW but plays most games I throw at it just fine, Don't Starve and Factorio etc.Only down side is that I wished it had more ram.I'm learning Unity3D right now and the 8gb is kind of the bottleneck.	2	5	2	3	4
This computer has been such a disappointment. It looks beautiful and is extremely light and portable but it has caused nothing but trouble. Within a year I've had to replace the battery ( with little to no support from Asus despite multiple outreach). Keys regularly stick on the computer. It shuts off randomly and when on sleep mode, will frequently switch itself on and drain the battery over night. I've taken it to multiple people for check up and fixes and other than some serious hardware flaws, no one can quite figure out the problem.I'm quite gentle with my devices. I carry them in cases, I keep them clean and relatively dust free, I update my software including malware protection regularly but for whatever reason, this Asus has continued to be a let down.Not to mention absolutely zero customer service. I will be buying a new computer as soon as I can and not returning to Asus products again.Definitely worth it to just pay $300 more for a macbook air.	2	5	2	3	4
Light, fast, thin and good battery life.	2	5	2	3	4
Great. Fast laptop. Colors are great. Can handle the programs that were the biggest cpu hogs on my old laptop with ease.	3	1	5	8	6
I was shocked about how affordable this is for the specs it has. I love the color, the big screen, the 4 processors, the 1T of memory, and the 16gbs of RAM, but it's already having issues! It sometimes makes a strange, ear piercing, static noise and goes black and takes a while to restart, and from day 1, it easily overheats (even when it's over a hard surface).	3	1	5	8	6
Literally the best laptop I've ever owned the 16gb of DDR4 Ram and Quad-core processor makes it very fast at multiple demanding programs like Adobe Creative Suite applications, Sketch, and so much more. I'm happy so far with this machine, HP did a great job with this one.	3	1	5	8	6
"Graphics are awesome. However, the performance isn't always great. There are frequent updates that can take an hour to finish. When I've set the computer to update and shut down, it's gone on standby while updating multiple times. This means that the next time I want to use the computer, I try to turn it back on and it hasn't finished updating yet, so I can't use it right away. I'm trying to start working from home, so I need a computer that's more reliable than that.Loud fan, as others have commented. The product description when I bought it said that this has a ""quiet fan,"" which isn't true. Also, there have been times when the computer has struggled to perform when all I had open were some Chrome tabs and a Steam game. I didn't expect my game to have poor graphics and start lagging under those circumstances. Seems weird for something that claims to ""smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once.""Honestly, I wish I hadn't spent so much money on this. But I missed the return window, and it's better than nothing."	3	1	5	8	6
This is NOT the laptop pictured... the photos show a machine with a smart card reader and a docking station port... this machine has neither. The specs are right, but don't judge this by the photos.	3	1	5	8	6
Terrible battery life. Tons of RAM, but it’s really slow. Updates fail constantly.Disappointed for sure. I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone.	3	1	5	8	6
The noise from hard drive and cooling fan are too too loud on this HP. I could not take it. I returned it. Our other HP computers at home are very quite.	3	1	5	8	6
Horrible. Shut down, cursor is gone..no fix works. Where do I return on file a complaint? This is the work computer I have ever had	3	1	5	8	6
Bought this for my daughter. The only reason she says four instead of five stars is that she is using it for online classes and if she leaves closed for too long it shuts down. She has two young children gets interrupted often.	3	1	5	8	6
It’s been dependable for schoolwork. However it does glitch sometimes when trying to wake it up. Also the log in screen doesn’t always appear- which causes you to have to click one of the annoying advertisements in order to get the computer to respond.	3	1	5	8	6
Love this little laptop, and you can't beat it for the price. I purchased it as both a backup machine and to have some portability to work in warmer parts of my house during the winter months.I don't need a lot of bells and whistles on my laptops, and this Chromebook does everything I need it to. I am a writer and work all day on my computer; the keyboard is responsive enough without being oversensitive. I purchased a mouse to go with my Chromebook, but so far, I've just been using the trackpad, which is every bit as good as the one on my old Mac.The battery seems to last forever--I think I'm getting about eight hours out of mine, with multiple tabs open and streaming a few hours of video every day.The profile of the Chromebook is slim, and the machine feels very lightweight, yet it is substantial enough to hold on my lap without necessarily using a laptop desk.The screen's resolution is fine for my purposes, although the text size is smaller than what I've been used to, and I'm feeling a little eye strain. I need to see if I can adjust the settings to enlarge browser fonts. That said, most of my time of the Chromebook so far has been surfing the net; normally, I'd be on Google docs more, where presumably I could enlarge the font as needed. The glare-resistant screen makes it easy to work in front of a window. Also, this feature means I don't have to keep adjusting the screen angle when watching Netflix, for example, and changing my position on the sofa (I don't own a TV, so my computers are my entertainment). Fourteen inches seems to be the perfect size--anything smaller, and I think typing would be a challenge.This is a great machine for writing, Internet research and correspondence, and watching Netflix, Youtube, etc. The fanless model is of course quiet, but it still runs cool. I don't really miss a backlit keyboard (the only feature I wanted but couldn't get on my list of preferences), since I mostly type by touch anyway, and I never work in the complete dark. This is basically like having a faster, more comfortable tablet (ready to go in seconds) without having to install a bunch of apps (I'm fine running most things through my browser). I like the pared-down feeling of the Chromebook.So far, so good, and I'm very happy with the purchase. I've had good luck with HP products in the past, so fingers crossed.	2	1	0	0	4
We are very happy with the purchase of this Chromebook. My daughter was starting high school and she needed a laptop that she could do homework on nightly. Increasingly, she was using the family desktop or laptop for homework and my husband and I had to compete for computer time! We wanted a trusted name, good functionality and a good price. This was perfect! Now she has her own designated laptop and we didn't break the bank! No more fighting over computer time at our house. This fit the bill!	2	1	0	0	4
Bought this for our office computer which only needed to get emails and check backgrounds on the web. Would defiantly recommend for anyone wanting an inexpensive way to surf the web. It's like an Android tablet with a keyboard and large screen. I think this is an excellent value.	2	1	0	0	4
This is a wonderful laptop. Just open it up and start working. 10 hr battery life. Streams movies & TV shows great. Tip: Buy a Chromecast too, you won't be sorry. Just remember that to get the biggest bang from a Chromebook it must be connected to the internet. It seriously makes my 2 year old HP windows laptop feel like a dinosaur.	2	1	0	0	4
We've had this for about 2 or 3 months now. This is our first Chromebook to replace a regular PC Laptop, we've had several and they just don't seem to last more than a couple of years, they get slow, it seems like a lot of unecessary software. For our needs, just paying bills, surfing the internet, it seemed like this might be worth a try. So far we've been very satisfied, it's fast and slim. Knock on wood, hopefully it lasts a long time and we will forever be Chromebook people.	2	1	0	0	4

I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and I tried to do my best because I don't know much about computers. Luckily, it seems I did good. He loves it. It is fast, light weight, and has an HDMI connection which the last Chromebook he had did not. He is very happy with the purchase and says he can't tell any major difference between the more expensive Chromebook he uses for work and this one.	2	1	0	0	4

Honestly it was a great product and I enjoyed it, great battery life, lighting fast browsing speeds and the simplicity of it made it incredible easy to use and the touch pad was very convenient. The only down side was the operating system, I had no idea chrome os couldn't fun regular PC programs but most times you can find a pretty good substitute in the very extensive chrome os App Store so all in all I love the laptop just wish I did a little more research before I bought it	2	1	0	0	4

Being a Google User the set up was a breeze. Within 10 minutes I had confirmed not only my Google Apps, but was also able to confirm my Netflix, Amazon, Comcast accounts all intact and ready to go.The audio is not as loud as reviews indicated. The keyboard will take a little time to get used too, but they all are. So far I am very pleased. Rate is 4 Stars only because I have only had the unit for a half hour.Even arrived a day earlier than stated.	2	1	0	0	4
nice device, works well, met all expectations. It's a great option for someone not requiring Windows.	2	1	0	0	4
This Chromebook exceeded my expectations. It's fast and can handle multiple tabs, but is comfortable to type on extensively and gets the job done. The only thing I would ask for otherwise would be for it to feel a little more durable.	2	1	0	0	4
I love this computer. It boots quickly, has no noisy fan, it's fast and easy to use. My husband has one too and we both love them. This is a simple computer for someone who loves to browse the web and download pictures. It took me a day or two to learn my way around on it, but now it's easy. All you do is sign in with your gmail address and you're on! Great price for a computer.	2	1	0	0	4

This is my first chrome book and I think it's great! It's sleek and run fast. I was disappointed to learn after I bought it, you cannot install iTunes on a chromebook.	2	1	0	0	4
It’s perfect for a high school student. I can write papers, and I can watch videos at 1080p60 no problem. You cannot game on it but that’s not what you’re purchasing here.	2	1	0	0	4

I love my chromebook! Thank you Leo LaPorte for talking about it so much on your Tech Guy radio and podcast! It is because of you that I bought the chromebook!

All my favorite things to do with a lightweight,easy to carry laptop	2	1	0	0	4

My 88 yr old mother had always been frustrated with whatever laptop she had at the time. I bought her this to make things simpler for her AND because she was convinced that she would be able to see a white keyboard better than black. She loves this chromebook.	2	1	0	0	4

I got rid of my Microsoft PC and have been using this Chromebook as my primary PC since purchasing it.Its fast and screen size is great with really good graphics quality, I dont miss the Microsoft software updates or the hassles of anti virus software.	2	1	0	0	4
Long Battery Life. Pretty good sound for laptop speakers, and pretty durable build construction. There's no lag for Facebook, Netflix streaming, etc.Can't beat it for the price.	2	1	0	0	4
Bought it for my brother and he loves it !! It's lightweight enough to take to class and durable enough to survive his backpack. LOL. Turns on super fast and he is able to have multiple tabs open without a decrease in performance. Highly recommended.	2	1	0	0	4
What a phenomenal laptop for the price.Great screen, lightening fast, really nice looking, the almost instant on and off feature is a wonderful feature when you are in a hurry.The 14 inch screen is the perfect size for carting around, I am extremely happy with it, and all for around $200.I highly recommend.	2	1	0	0	4

So far I really love this notebook. I bought one of the first generation Chromebooks and even though I understood that it was meant purely for accessing the internet I was disappointed. I then bought an ASUS Chromebook that only lasted about 8 months. It just went black one day and I couldn't get it to come back on. Fortunately they aren't too expensive. THIS HP Chromebook is amazing. It allows me to play games of all kinds, it's fast ---- there's just nothing to complain about.	2	1	0	0	4

Bought one last year I think and have been very pleased with it for just surfing the net. Only thing it did was once in a while it would power off in the middle of something, but i pressed the on key and it came back up. Hope this doesn't mean something might go wrong in the future. If it does, it's given me plenty of service for what i paid	2	1	0	0	4

My husband and I bought a pair of Chromebooks. It took all of 30 seconds to set these up before we were surfing the web. They are basic but that is all we were looking for. Browsing, shopping, banking, emailing, Youtubeing and facebooking. I had to Google how to right click because it only has a touch pad, no left or right click. I still haven't figured out how to copy and paste, but I haven't had a need so I am sure I can figure it out. It is a great product for basic use and the price is awesome!	2	1	0	0	4

The space bar barely works on far left side.No-wonder its only $200.	2	1	0	0	4
The computer itself functions just fine but the screen resolution isn't the best in bright spaces, the camera isn't great but it has a fww filters so that's pretty awesome, the battery life is very good it takes about 1 hour or 2 to get full charge if you start charging it with about 5% or 7% battery life, you can have quite a lot of pages open in the internet and it won't slow down, also the speakers are more than i expected for this price, they are pretty loud also the chromebook itself is made of plastic so it isn't heavy but the fact that it's plastic doesn't make it look cheap. I would say this product is good for the price that it has, i would definetly recommend it for teens or for a laptop that you would just have for entertainment scince it doesn't include any microsoft programs. Please rate this review if you thought it was helpful, have a nice day.	2	1	0	0	4

"We purchased this laptop for our son to be able to connect to his homeschool website and perform the various activities expected of him on a daily basis.One of the biggest parts is the daily ""class connect"" sessions that uses JAVA software to connect him live to his teacher and fellow classmates. With all the research we did before purchase, it was never brought to our attention that Chrome 45 and later no longer support Java, thus making it impossible for him to log on everyday.Therefore we had to return this laptop so that we can repurchase one that does support JAVA, since it is such a critical part of his curriculum.Which was unfortunate, besides the problem stated above it seemed to be a perfect fit for us, him, and our wallet."	2	1	0	0	4

I am so disappointed with this product. To start with, it takes a very long time to connect to my wifi at home. I'm not sure why. At home we have an iMac and Macbook, which all start up immediately when turned on. This morning alone, I had to input my password four times in order for it to connect and it never happened. When it had connected during this week, the processing is very slow and takes a very long time, minutes, for each new tab to upload. I don't have that kind of time when a Mac gives me immediate service. I'm sending it back, not worrying about the cost of a Mac, and heading to the store to purchase a new one. I'm a HUGE fan of all things Google and was really wanting to fall in love with the Chrome Book. I'm so upset.	2	1	0	0	4
It's fast. It's clean. But I didn't know and didn't see anyone anywhere mention that with a chromebook, you can't download other browsers easily. I also don't like that there's not a caps lock button. Not used to that, and when I hit where it usually is, it brings up a google search box. The price is right and the quality is pretty good, but I don't like having google chrome as my browser overlord. Battery life is good though. And it's pretty lightweight.	2	1	0	0	4

I really dislike this operating system. It's not compatible with almost any apps. It's very difficult to print with and the app set up is annoying. It you're used to a windows computer, I wouldn't suggest getting this.	2	1	0	0	4

Buyer beware: this hunk of junk cannot skype. It has a camera, and it is 2016, so logic would suggest that it can, it cant. Chrome just doesn't allow it. I will be selling this at a loss and replacing with a full feature laptop. This should only be purchased for internet browsing.	2	1	0	0	4
