"Just received the HP Chromebook....I understand that it's a refurbished product, BUT for it to look as extremely used buy everyone in the world is very disappointing. I thought I was going to get a Chrome colored unit, but instead I received a dingy white one that's all scratched up and discolored! I didn't even want to turn it on! Once I turned it on, it seemed to work fine, but found out that it doesn't even have a ""Caps Lock"" button! Wow. Never again. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!"	2	1	0	0	4
