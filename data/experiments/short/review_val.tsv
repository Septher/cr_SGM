This is the worst misrepresentation by the seller. Both Samsung products were refurbished and that is why it was presented at a lower price for $139.99. Both products have lots of scratches on top monitor. One of them on the left corner of the keyboard is bent and cracked. I was planning to give them as Christmas gifts to my daughters, now I have to return them and get another set. Really disappointment.	0	9	0	0	4

Great except the small hard drive has now become a problem as I'm unable to update my Windows 10 due to not enough hard drive space. The updater said it needed 8GB free, so I uninstalled MS Office (over 1GB) leaving myself with over 9GB free. But that's still not enough, and the update has failed a few times.	2	0	0	1	5
I love my new laptop I can play games like Destiny 2 & The Division, basically any game I want to play at really good settings. I love the fact that it has a USB type-c port so I can charge my phone on it. I carry it everywhere with me, it replaced my Surface and I couldn't be happier.	3	6	3	3	0

After researching as much as this technically illiterate person could about the cheapest but best laptop. This is a nice laptop for the money but I was a little disappointed in the speed of internet browsing.	3	2	1	8	7
So far, absolutely pathetic. I've only had it a few hours and it struggles to run the most basic tasks. The display, some have mentioned, is lack-luster. Let me clarify and say that I would get better clarity and color from a slide-projector out in broad-daylight. The 8gb of ram and Core i5 run slower than my Lenovo Tablet with a single core Atom processor and 2gb of ram. The good news is that if there is a flood in your area, you can stay afloat on the incredible amounts of bloatware that come with this. This laptop also claims to have an Nvidia GTX 1050. I'd let you know how it works, but so far it doesn't even recognize its existence and would rather use Intel HD Graphics. I BOUGHT A GAMING LAPTOP AND IT'S USING INTEL HD GRAPHICS!? Incredible! I must say‚Äî Dell really outdid themselves on this one. I hope their team enjoyed all the time the took off during the development of this laptop, because this truly feels like a product designed in a few hours. Incredibly pathetic. This has to go back. Last Dell I own. Period.	3	7	3	8	0

Good performance, just as expected. The S-pen works great, the touch screen is very nice. Great for entertainment not for having just this one as your work laptop. Use it as a backup or as portable lighter laptop.	1	1	0	1	4
I got this during a lightning deal which dropped the price to around 932 USD including tax. It's definitely cheaper than the 999$ starting price on the Dell website but I have seen it go lower with discounts and coupons.Build quality is solid all around (keyboard deck is metal, everywhere else is good quality plastic) and the cooling system is awesome. The fans literally don't turn on when you're just browsing the internet. Fan noise is decent during heavy load.My unit came with Sandisk X400 128gb M.2 (not NVMe) and 4GB x 2 sticks of Hynix DDR4-2400 RAM (which I kinda hated since I hoped it would come with a single 8GB stick). It would've been better if they sold the 256GB SSD model here as well.	3	7	2	8	0
Mine also had the Phantom Touchscreen issue beginning after about 4 months of use. Took it back to Best Buy, they sent it off, it came back in less than two weeks with a replaced screen and no charge because they deal with Samsung So I don't have to. So far so good with the fix.If you are in the US and are having issues, take it to Best Buy. They can help whether you purchased thru them or not.Other than that, it has been a great little machine!	1	1	0	1	4

This is a super great laptop for the price I paid! I was a little bit apprehensive prior to purchasing this laptop due to reviews other people had written about its functionality and lack of storage space. However, I have purchased an additional micro SD card to store my files and have downloaded a handful of programs, yet the laptop is still functioning rather well!I am a college student and my last laptop of broke down on me toward the end of this past academic year, so I was looking for something small and lightweight that would provide all the basic functions I would need as a college student who travels fairly frequently. This laptop is wonderful if you have the appropriate expectations for the price that you paid.	2	0	0	1	5
This is a very nice laptop with a full range of features for the selling price. The 7th Gen Intel i5 Core with 2.5Ghz is a quick enough processor for my speed needs. The 1TB HDD has more than enough capacity for my storage needs. And I find the Business Manager and Fingerprint Scanner very helpful in IT managing and security issues. Five stars for affordability vs features, speed and capacity.	3	9	2	8	3
It is a beautiful laptop, arrived in perfect (refurbished but couldn't tell) condition. it boots up very fast, and runs in perfect condition. I can play games and do all my paper work. Surprisingly, even I opened multiple tabs and browsers, it still response very fast, no delay at all, doing much better job than my desktop (though it is old, but has i5 in it).It was a great price and I would recommend doing business with these guys	2	0	0	1	4
Turned on the laptop; updated everything and suddenly started freezing... poor performance! It is not what is says in the descriptio. Laptop should have lasted at least 5 hours battery life when using HDD But unfortunately this one lasts not more than 2 hours. And as stated; brand new laptop; good Quality on hardware but software just sucks; freezes when you open media player and second simple software. Just hate it after a week of purchase.	3	9	2	8	3

Love this laptop!!! I use it as a trading station and for any gaming with my kids. It's nicely priced, and truly is a beast with an overall small weight. Only critique is it does show hand/fingerprints so you do need to clean it occasionally or it looks like a giant smudge.	3	7	2	8	0
I purchased this laptop for my wife as an early Christmas present. So far is has performed about as expected, with some slight surprises in speed. She plans on using this for web browsing and very light photo editing. Should any glaring defect present itself I will note it on this review.Being an ASUS product I'd expect nothing less than a quality Item. I've never had any issue with any of their products.	2	0	0	1	5
"The i5 with 8gb of RAM isn't sufficient for engineers, artists, and other heavy users, but it's probably perfect for managers and others who only do email and documents. Obviously upgrade to Windows 10 Pro (I think ""S"" stands for ""Sham""), but the process was painful for me, requiring two MS support sessions, but they eventually figured it out.It uses the Surface base station which works extremely well, better than even Apple's offering. I have it plugged into a 2256x1504 res monitor and it can handle the extra pixels just fine. The Laptop's own display is extremely sharp and gorgeous, although some apps don't yet support high density displays, but overall it's nice. The fabric feels really good, and my palms never stick to it like what usually happens with metal laptops when it heats up. The keyboard has a great feel, but that's subjective. The touchpad isn't as good as a Macbook's, but is decent enough. The touchscreen and pen support are wonderful, even though the pen lags (it isn't for artists, otherwise gets the job done well enough).Doesn't get a full 5 because the lid is difficult to open (the magnet/hinge is too string, probably so it won't shake much when touching the screen), and Windows 10 is still very buggy. I don't like including Windows in the review, but fact is, it's a part of the laptop, so here we are."	2	8	2	3	3

.This was a replacement computer for my HP as the hard drive was going. This HP is faster and easier to use. Still getting used to the new features and Windows 10.

Styling-aside, no one should mistake this for a MacBook-class performance laptop, but what the CB+ sacrifices in speed and flexibility, it makes up for in battery life, convenience, and price.I have the pleasure of working across many different devices each week and have been using the CB+ for a few months now as a fallback, all-day WordPress editor and Google Apps biz box. For those purposes it's a mixed bag, but for the price of < $500 it's hard to complain too much: there is a lot here. Here's the breakdown from ~3 months use:PERFORMANCEAs others have said, if all you need is a casual email, web browsing, and the Google Apps suite, this device fits the bill and offers some great flexibility with the stylus and touchscreen. Once you get into more complex webpage renderings, use it for a biz where time = money, or intend to use storage outside of the Google ecosystem, things get more challenging. FTP clients are few and poorly designed, web page edits/reloads are slower than an entry-level iPad, and the ability to work across different cloud containers is often limited to the Android ecosystem, with its own issues (see below). In fact, as I am typing in this review box with 4 Chrome tabs and a couple Android apps open, the system is stuttering, pausing, and exhibiting an ever so slight lag when backspacing or typing quickly.DESIGNWorking long hours on my MacBook Pro is difficult with its sharp front edges. The CB+ solves for this with its rounded edges, light weight, and surprisingly thin width. I can throw it in a bag, forget its there, and use it all day without any concern over battery life. On the other hand, if you are buying thinking it is a cheap route to tablet XP, think again. The beauty of an iPad is its singular focus as a 1lb touchscreen you hold in your hand first and attach a keyboard onto at your desk later. Flip-book designs like the CB+ are 2lb+ laptops first, with software-accelerated passive styli designed to mimic the no-lag, active styli on iPad Pros and Surfaces. Its not the same thing and near impossible to hold in one hand for any length of time given the 2x weight, larger screen size, and power button you will grow tired of accidentally hitting as you balance the device on a knee or leg. This is 90% laptop, 10% tablet.SCREENThis is why you buy this device. Stunning and the showcase of the device. Given the lower performance specs, you could almost consider it a $400 touch screen with a keyboard attached. Easy on the eyes over long periods of working, with the flexibility of ratcheting up to eye-squintingly high resolutions when needed.KEYBOARDThe flip side of the light weight and thin dimensions is a squishy, cheap-feeling keyboard light years behind the clickety, tactile feel of the my MacBook (or even iPad Pro Smart KB case). The lack of caps lock and tiny tab and backspace keys make it a challenge to switch back and forth between this device and others. The absence of lighted keys (not surprising at this price) distracting when switching off higher-priced laptops.ANDROID APPSAndroid apps on Chromebook are a love/hate experience. Love: immediate access to local, offline apps far more enjoyable to use than web-based equivalents. Hate: apps run in a shared sandbox, one app crashes, they all crash out. While many apps do effectively scale up to full window resolutions, its generally an either/or experience: phone-sized mini windows or full screen Chrome ones. Apps are also limited in features, most stripped down to features applicable on a smartphone versus more complete feature sets you expect on a laptop. While impressive that developers have allowed their apps to scale to a full sized view, there is years of work needed to get these apps to a level commensurate to what you would expect to see on an iPad, which faced the same challenge of years of developers optimizing their iPhone apps for larger screens. In short, a great addition with strong promise, but years ahead of it to bring Chromebooks to the same level as their MS or Apple equivalents.SUMMARYAll in all a decent jack of all trades, master of none device for those on a tight budget and seeking a predominantly keyboard-driven, traditional laptop experience < $500. Anything above that and you're better off looking at an iPad + KB (faster, lighter, more versatile) or Mac/Windows laptop (faster, more versatile, better resale).	1	1	0	1	4
While there was a learning curve, going from an eleven year old laptop to a Chromebook, I now love it. So fast and portable. Charges quickly with excellent battery life. Love the touch screen, purchased an add on number pad for spreadsheets. Never use the stylus though.	1	1	0	1	4
The one thing I DO NOT LIKE is that it shuts itself down to update and then restarts without warning. I have yet to figure out how to control that, as I have done in the settings what I am supposed to do. For all I know, it could be Windows doing that. With previous computers, I would get asked about installing updates, whether to do it then OR do it later. Not with this -- at least at the present time.	3	7	3	8	6
I was looking for an everyday laptop with a ssd. I didn't want to spend much money because I don't store anything on my computers and I am not a gamer. I just use it for internet, email, bills, word documents, etc. I liked the size and look of this one, so I bought it with really no expectations due to the price etc. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a very sharp looking laptop. Super lightweight and quiet. If you are looking for something like I was it is definitely a great purchase for the money. You can't beat it for that price.	2	0	0	1	2
I have never written a review before, but I feel compelled to since I just completed my return. Like many customers, I purchased this product for it's extremely reasonable price. It was a gift for my wife so that she could use it for school. The box comes and as I go through the set up process, I am unable to connect to my wireless network. After multiple attempts and a call to ASUS customer support, it turns out that this is a hardware issue. I have never purchased any technology that didn't work out of the box. I have zero faith that if I was to receive a new laptop it would come without issue. This will be the last time that I buy an electronic device primarily based on it's price. Anyone considering this laptop should invest a little more money for better quality.	2	0	0	1	5
This computer stinks. It‚Äôs slower than my 6 y/o Samsung, shuts down randomly and while I don‚Äôt have a lot on it yet ( and may just get rid of it) my security/malware is picking up a lot of issues and it‚Äôs only 53% optimized?! Very disappointed- cheap but... c‚Äômon guys!	3	0	0	8	2
I bought the Chromebook plus the morning it came out. I was really excited to have something portable for work. However, after using it for a couple months I'm not really impressed. I have constant issues with the WiFi ( all my other devices n the house don't have any issue ) and the pen already broke with normal use and is now stuck inside the machine. I can't exchange or return it because it's past the date. It's cheaply made and constant issues of freezing, wifi connection, screen moving on its own, etc. I had sent it in to Samsung twice and they refused to fix the system. Don't recommend. Put your money elsewhere	1	1	0	1	4
"I have the i7, 512GB SSD, with 16GB of RAM. I got this laptop because I needed a powerful laptop to run programs like SolidWorks and ANSYS but that was a reasonable price and small enough to bring to class. This laptop is not as small or light as the 2 in 1 ultra thin laptops but it is not big and bulky. I had an old 17.3"" laptop before this and compared to that this is tiny. But the 15.6 still has a big enough screen for multitasking with multiple windows. The batter life is great. I have not timed it but it seems to be outstanding. I have played Player Unknown Battlegrounds and it handled it great, although it ate a ton of battery. It is fast and responsive. Super sleek looking. Full keyboard is nice. I like that it has 3 USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet. The only complaints would be the outside does smudge very easily, the fans are pretty loud, and there seems to be quite a bit of bloat ware. Seems to use up a lot of RAM when idling or web surfing."	3	7	3	8	0

Really trying to like it as it is quite an expensive computer but i just can't. This computer is a lot thinner than my 2013 Asus gaming laptop, which is great. But geez the sound of the fans is just driving me crazy, as I opened a game I could hear the fans start spinning like crazy, which my previous laptop has never done. Overall it is working good so far but ever since I turned it on the fan has not yet taken a break.. not sure how long this laptop can last as the fan may go out before everything else and consequently fry itself up.	3	8	3	8	0
This little laptop is amazing. I received it at the same time I bought a Dell Ultrabook, and it will replace my wife's Lenovo laptop that is dying. Externally the laptop has a minimalist styling, lots of aluminum with a tasteful Microsoft logo. It's a little heavier than my ultrabook, which makes sense as the ultrabook is all plastic, and no touch screen. The screen on the Surface is sharp and beautiful. Setup only took a few minutes. I was disappointed when I tried to install Chrome though, and the the pre-installed OS wouldn't allow it. Luckily it did prompt me to switch to regular Windows 10, which I did. Since then I was able to install my normal software suite. The machine is incredibly fast and quiet. It doesn't heat up the way our old Lenovo did. The camera is very high quality as well, my wife's relatives have all commented that her video quality has improved alot. I really like having the touch screen, as I use a tablet daily. I found myself toughing other laptop screens out of habit, with nothing happening...My wife and I are very happy with this high quality laptop, it's a great upgrade to our older equipment.	2	7	2	3	3

Very fast device and lightweight, it is also very silent. I can hear no sound at all coming from it, I worked at the airport for a long time so it could be that, but definitively it is sound free or almost.Office and Windows work just fine, just activated the feature Find My Device in case of lost or steal.Keyboard is fine, just the right size, it doesn't feel small, and keys are very responsive, I would love to have an illuminated keyboard.Charger size is close to any other cellphone charger, which is really nice and easy to store, not the usual heavy laptop charger.Battery can last for several hours as advised, but that number gets reduced if you use it on maximum performance mode, of course.Something that really disappointing me is the color. It doesn't look gold at all, at normal sight. You have to literally compare it with another laptop that is grey or silver to notice the little (way too little) touch of gold that it has. Thanks Asus for making gold computers, just use deeper tone.----UPDATE----This computer keeps having issues reading my 1 TB Western Digital Drive, it keeps shutting it down. I have change settings for energy, and also on the USB controllers to do not power off the device, but it keeps doing it. The drive is working as usual in my HP work computer and in my Dell Desktop. Such a shame that this little thing is having that issue, I can't really watch anything from my drive because it gets disconnected in like 4 minutes, I have to save things to my documents first, but wait, I also don't have much space.I hope Asus can fix this issue with a driver update, I am an IT tech, and I can use the computer like this, I don't mind, but it shouldn't be like that. One star down.	2	0	0	1	5
I really like this laptop. It is indeed quite fast especially noticeable at startup. Note that two slots for the memory are installed in a more difficult to access location (requires taking laptop apart). However, I was fairly easily able to install 2 16GB = 32 GB of additional ram in the two available slots. I used the crucial memeory (Ballistix Sport). Also note that the solid state drives are 2 x 128 GB which i find unfortunate because I had wanted to add a larger solid state drive but found the slots were both taken. Therefore to upgrade the size of the solid state drive or drives you have to image your hardrive somewhere and copy it over to a new drive. I understand you can install an Nvme (a faster solid state drive) but I haven't done this yet. Last thing, I had a brief issue with the sleep mode but I believe it was due to out of date drivers.	4	7	5	8	0
I received my new laptop a few weeks ago and must say I love my ZenBook! Super light, super thin, and super fast! I was worried I would have a lot of bloatware (as my Dell came with) but besides a couple of games I could easily delete, it was just right! The fingerprint scanner is nice, but not as good as an iPhone. It doesn‚Äôt always read accurately-not a big enough problem to doc a rating from. Overall very pleased.	2	5	2	3	4
What can I say? From the leather like feel of the palm rest, to the amazingly vibrant screen, to the crazy battery life, this is one darn good machine. Battery Life - I work in Word, Excel, Outlook and OneNote all day long, and using those programs (with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth on, Display at recommended, and power at recommended) I am receiving 16-18 hours of battery life. When I browse the internet in my free time I get closer to 12-14 hours, so high internet usage will drain your battery faster, but still, those are some amazing numbers.Display - Bright, vibrant colors. I have never had a problem reading anything, even outdoors.Keyboard and trackpad - there is a tiny bit of keyboard flex, but the keys are fine, and the trackpad is wow. The same glass trackpad as the Surface Book (read amazing)OS - I have yet to require an app outside of the Windows Store, but if you do, grab your free update to Windows 10 Pro.Graphics - can do basic gaming, but no powerhouse.Overall - great machine	2	7	2	3	3
I've used this Chromebook for about 2 days now and wanted to pass along my first thoughts. Keep in mind, I currently own a 2016 Macbook Pro and had a Chromebook Pixel 2. I can tell you off the bat that this is no Chromebook Pixel (one of my favorite devices ever).I'm only giving this device 3 stars as of right now (being generous) because as Google has said.....the software is still in beta mode. From initial boot up, until today..... this thing has resets, freezes and other hiccups all over the place. I see the potential though so I'm not going to be harsh. I spent about 30 minutes composing a message that was suddenly lost due to a random re-boot. Wasn't thrilled.The screen is as beautiful as claimed. Touch sensitivity and quality up there with the Chromebook Pixel. I was pleasantly surprised. The touchpad has a great feel to it and is as responsive as almost any other Chromebook I've used. Still doesn't beat a Macbook glass touchpad though. (I know it's an unfair comparison)Keyboard is just OK with satisfying key travel....but wish it was a bit better. Other reviewers have claimed the keyboard to be a bit cramped which I can attest to. When typing away, the small changes to key size (tab, delete) become apparent and its just something you'll have to get used to. Not a deal breaker.Been getting about 8 hours of battery life. So far so good.Hope this helps with your research. My opinion, wait until the bugs are smoothed out. Maybe by the release of the Pro model (that all black look too) they'll have most of this corrected.I miss my Pixel.	1	1	0	1	4
I love the fact that it is potable, Its easy to operate and it's fashionable. But I have the following challenges1. How to operate an offline office package on it, do I have to pay monthly to operate word,excel etc.2.

Nine hours of battery life, runs Windows 10, and is capable of running Android Studio and building Android apps. If you're looking to take light productivity (presentations, writing, blogging, programming, etc.) wherever you go, and counting on it to have enough battery to get something done on a whim, there is simply no better choice.Obviously you get what you pay for, and you're not buying a computer that plays the latest & greatest video games, nor will it do you any good for professional video editing, but if you have a workstation and feel like remoting in to get work done, this product is going to be your favorite at this price point.1080p screen ‚Äî Plenty of screen estateFanless ‚Äî It doesn't run hot enough to need oneBattery life ‚Äî Will last longer than it takes Tool to release their next albumThin and light ‚Äî Just stick it in a sleeve and throw it in your bag	2	0	0	1	2
Good build quality,light weight.Easy to carry around anywhere.Sleek design.Not the best audio quality,but is good for people who use it for office work.People using it for media purposes,its not the best option.	2	7	3	8	3
Received and returned same day. The serial number seemed to be scratched off because it left a groove mark and then stuck on with a sticker. It was dirty. Still had fingerprints on it. It croaked when I opened the screen because it had a crack in the corner. Multiple scrape marks. Not worth the money so I returned and purchased it new for just $58 more.	2	1	0	0	4
The computer is awesome. It is much bigger than the normal laptop but i love the cursor touch pad, it feels smooth. Also the keys are smooth and quiet. This is not a laptop to be carrying everywhere you since it is a little heavier than most but it is a awesome computer.	4	7	5	8	0
Personally, I did not like this laptop. Initially, I thought that this is a perfect laptop for simple web browsing. But, when I got this laptop and started browsing I did not like the speed of browsing. Pages load slowly despite super good internet connection. Processor often touches its 100% capacity and slows the laptop. Not at all recommended. RETURNED the laptop	2	0	0	1	5
Laptop came defective. It ran slow and glitchy on the first day, the battery drained itself only after about an hour and a half, and then it couldn‚Äôt even install a basic program like iTunes. After a few hours of troubleshooting what‚Äôs wrong with the laptop, I found a corrupted directory in the system. To make matters worse, it just kept giving me more and more problems: it shut down randomly and got stuck on the ‚Äúgetting ready‚Äù Lenovo splash screen, and when it finally got unstuck it took over an hour to boot back up! This all happened the first day out of the box, and it‚Äôs giving me a headache. So needless to say, it‚Äôs being returned.	3	2	1	8	7
I‚Äôve been waiting for this version (the UX430-DH74) since it‚Äôs updated with intel‚Äôs 8th gen low-power cores, which for the first time are quad rather than dual core. So it was definitely worth waiting a couple of months for that.Overall, this is a great laptop ‚Äì I love it. The 14‚Äù screen is beautiful, with plenty of brightness, and it‚Äôs matte which is my preference. It‚Äôs not touch-enabled, which might be a dealbreaker for some, but I don‚Äôt see the point in touch screens on laptops anyway, and I detest their glossy reflections. It does use PWM to modify brightness however; which shouldn't affect the majority of users but some might get eyestrain or headaches. It doesn't affect me personally so it's fine, and a lot of modern screens use PWM so it can be difficult to avoid.Overall, build quality is pretty good. There is a tiny flex in the metal surrounding the keypads, and again in the lid, but it‚Äôs negligible and barely noticeable and certainly shouldn‚Äôt impact usage.Other reviews have noted the cooling performance, and yes, the fans do start up when doing cpu intensive tasks. Some people have installed Notebook Fan Control to increase the heat threshold at which the fan operates, but I haven‚Äôt since it doesn‚Äôt really bother me ‚Äì with normal usage, I certainly can‚Äôt hear it over other background noises coming in from outside/my fridge. It‚Äôs noticeable when it is under stress, but that tends to only be when I‚Äôm doing some light gaming and I‚Äôll either have headphones in or music playing. On the whole, I‚Äôd rather the fan switches on to keep the cpu cool than to have it heat up more but be quieter.The fingerprint sensor is a useful feature to have ‚Äì it saves a couple of seconds logging in. Scanning accuracy isn‚Äôt always great, though, and I‚Äôve added 3 different profiles of the same finger to ensure it always recognises me ‚Äì ie with cold/dry finger, wet shrivelled finger from the shower and a ‚Äònormal‚Äô one. This seems to work, though you do need to add slight pressure when using it or it doesn‚Äôt recognise you.On the whole this is a great laptop, very good value for money as Asus almost always is. Don‚Äôt let the negative reviews put you off: they seem to have defective units or subjective problems with the device ‚Äì I like the circular shine effect on the lid, it‚Äôs simple yet classy.	2	6	5	4	3
Great product so far. As an entrepreneur I'm always looking to save money yet invest in something that will help advance/increase my sales. Thanks HP for this perfect laptop.Also the sound is like having speakers in the house. Love it	2	1	0	0	4
The bad: it scuffs easily.The good: super slim, convertible, great display, seems to keep getting better with frequent OS updates (the unlock-by-phone feature only worked intermittently when I first purchased, now it works about 90% of the time?). Comes with a lot of freebies (6 months of Netflix, etc).	1	1	0	1	4
This is super lightweight, has enough space for the basics of what I need as a student. Comes with Windows 10. Very small, very reliable. Sometimes I have an issue with finding wifi on this, but restarting almost always fixes this bug.	2	0	0	1	5
Not a tech kinda person. I just wanted a laptop for uni that would be able to use word and PowerPoint and let me watch my lecture videos. Well, it‚Äôs fantastic. Nice and lightweight, thin, sleek and works really well. The best part is that the battery lasts for ages! I use my laptop every day for uni (~6 hours a day maybe more or less depending on the day) and I‚Äôll charge it probably 4 times a week! Love this laptop, definitely recommend!	2	5	2	3	4
This Chromebook exceeded my expectations. It's fast and can handle multiple tabs, but is comfortable to type on extensively and gets the job done. The only thing I would ask for otherwise would be for it to feel a little more durable.	2	1	0	0	4
This is a great laptop. The screen is brilliant, with rich colors and full HD. No, it's not 4K but I have little need for that in a laptop. 8gb of RAM powers the hungry Windows 10 just fine for everything I throw at it, which admittedly isn't incredibly demanding, but I also have a laptop that crawls along on 2gb RAM in Windows 10 making for a pretty miserable experience. My daughter draws on the computer a lot with a Wacom tablet and never encounters any issues. (This computer did NOT come with the pen. We'll buy one someday soon.)Using this laptop as a kind of tablet just isn't a great experience. Microsoft really hasn't been able to nail down a good tablet experience on a touchscreen PC just yet, but it is kind of handy when doing things such as drawing as I, at least, would rather touch the surface of the drawing rather than use a Wacom tablet. But outside of that, it's best in laptop mode or tent mode for video watching.	3	5	2	3	3
hardware is OK but the software preload is disastrous. Disabling all HP services and removing everything called McAfee helps... Having 2 AVs running in parallel (the MS one and McAfee on top) kills about 1/3 of the performance without even doing anything...	3	0	0	7	5
Got this for my lady for Christmas. She loves it: easier to use than a laptop, and easier to carry around. It's fast, lightweight, and helps her organize her busy schedule.	2	7	2	3	3
I bought this computer for my sister for Christmas and it actually performed better than what I expected. It's surprisingly fast and powerful for a laptop, plus it's build quality shows that. As for gaming, this thing absolutely owns it, with the ability to play literally any modern video game (I tested it with Overwatch and Destiny 2) at over 60fps at high graphics settings. This computer is great for power users, gamers and photo/video editors.	3	7	2	8	0
Great performance at a good price. I use it daily for both gaming and streaming and it has been able to handle everything I do. Would recommend the larger SSD since they tend to fill up quite quickly.	3	7	2	8	0
"I switched from Windows to Mac about 5 years ago. I swore I would never go back. I've been gotten increasingly annoyed with being in the iOS/Mac operating systems. About twice a month, I get prompted to change my iCloud password on my iPhone and then when I change it and go to use my MacBook Pro, I get flooded with ""login keychain"" error messages that I can't make go away. And then constant reminders to change my passwords even though I already have. In one of these frustrating moments, I happened to wander into a Microsoft store and landed in front of the new Surface laptop. I was pretty blown away. Great looking machine; very comfortable to use, and FAST. After hemming and hawing, I bought one - the basic $799 i5 model w/ 4 GB RAM and 128 SSD. I am beyond thrilled. I immediately downloaded the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. I have never experienced such a smooth, effortless, fast computing experience. This thing is great. They got this one right. Now going back to my MacBook seems like a downgrade!"	2	7	2	3	3
My daughter has been continually using this chromebook for her daily need during the past ten days. It has most features and priorities: ports, stability, simple handling, and great performance. It is a fairly powerful chromebook system. Everything feels very sturdy with a weight less than 4 pounds. It is also very well equipped with ports of HDMI, LAN, USB3.0/2.0, HD camera, bluetooth, etc. The wireless signal quality is very good.The touch of the keyboard is smooth and solid. The touchpad surface is conveniently easy to operate. The chromebook is quite most of time.Overall, it is a solid Chromebook which can be a very good alternative to a laptop. Thought certified refurbished, it looks and performs brand new ‚Äì a great buy.	2	1	0	0	4
"arrived on time, booted up windows, went through initial startup (create user account, etc.) and then as soon as i get to the desktop windows has a warning in the notification tray to restart my computer to repair errors on the drive. So after about 1.5hrs of reboots and windows self-repairing, the machine finally booted to windows again and said ""you are running low on space, click here to uninstall your old copy of windows"". After all that things seemed fine. Booted up the laptop the next day and it again says to repair drive errors. Also although the laptop seems speedy clicking around in windows and opening some basic apps (calculator, ip scanner, etc.) as soon as I open chrome and load a youtube page the things slows to a crawl, scrolling is super choppy, etc. It is not just youtube either, it seems to be anything that is graphics heavy like cnn or fox, theverge.com, vimeo, etc. Not sure if this is due to the ""hard drive errors"" or is indicative of general performance. Had high hopes to use this to just browse the web but the first impressions on top of the drive errors have ruined it for me. On top of it all my girlfriend took out the recycling the day after it arrived so I no longer have the original box to return it with so i'm stuck with it. Yay!"	2	0	0	1	5
im actually currently using this product right now and i bought it over a year ago. for the price its a darn good laptop and runs pretty well. i mostly use word and do school work and some browsing. i have to say this even saved me from wanting to purchase a mac its had its glitches but in reality for the price it gets the job done runs well and has significant storage. the camera is questionable but if youre video chatting it should be sufficient though it lags a little. but once again for the price its well worth it.	2	0	0	1	5
Almost perfect.This laptop, as well as any other dell inspiron gaming laptop, appears to have audio issues. I've tried but there's no current solution to the distorted/crackling sound problem while using the built-in speakers.With that aside, the laptop works flawlessly. Cool graphics, CPU, RAM and ports.	3	9	3	8	0
Graphics are not good. Battery life? 8hrs? Lol non- existent, more like 8 minutes. Cannot even connect to Wi-Fi properly. My old hp amda8 series... with a broken screen lol is working better. I've only had the laptop a few hours and I completely regret the purchase. The only good thing is the exterior looks bomb.	2	7	3	8	3
Why won't Acer make a windows version of the Acer Chromebook 14- with Crouton/Lubuntu installed it is akin to a Macbook and the very best value on the market of any laptop, with an incredible matte display. Hopefully the Acer Swift 1 is comparable, LonTV's review of it is encouraging. The Swift 3 here on Amazon does not have a sharp, matte HD display but rather a glossy retina-burning one and is therefore unacceptable.	2	0	0	1	2

This is a really a wonderful laptop which has more features which was impressive as ASUS is a quality product. The service from the seller was superb and wish to say thank you for selling this product on Amazon to South Africa.	3	9	2	8	3
Though my son loves it and it works good, the lack of HD and available space means you are stuck with Edge browser because there is not enough room for extra apps and programs. We bought a microSD to add storage for files and are still tweaking to get the most out of it. Battery life is good and the size is perfect if it is used on the go. I would not suggest it as your only computer . It is perfect for someone like my son who has a monster gaming computer at home and uses this one to stick in his backpack .	2	0	0	1	5
"Replacing an 8 year old 17"" Acer I ordered two different Acers only to return them both. This ASUS is GREAT. I love the configuration.

Thanks to Amazon Prime and their return policy I've got the the perfect laptop for my needs."	3	7	2	8	4
So I have bought a lot of laptops both cheap and super expensive. I thought Samsung had good quality and good hardware, but after using this I would tell everyone to stay away. All in all the chromebook was SUER slow. I was expecting super fast speed online and I barely got that. I think my Samsung phone might be faster. The other thing too, is that the Pen falls out and can be lost easily, and it is kinda useless in my opinion. No apps or things online really need a pen, so it‚Äôs a wasted feature. Give me a better screen or more sensitive mousepad than a pen that doesn‚Äôt do anything and falls out. The other thing is that the battery life is really bad. I don‚Äôt really use my chromebook for much but the battery was dead in about 3 hours from web browsing and playing music. My 5 year old laptop has about the same battery life. Maybe it is worth the wait for the pro model but this model is no good. I do not suggest anyone buy it.	1	1	0	1	4
Its pretty, and it arrived quick. Thats it. Its always updating or getting windows ready. Its almost a good computer....but its slow. As you can see in the pic, its doing it now. I haven't even used it in 2 days, and it already updated. Also when I first got it out of the box it updated for 3.5 hours until we finally turned it off and back on.	3	2	1	8	7
"UPDATE: ASUS asked me to return the laptop for keyboard repairs. Turns out there is no option to purchase onsite warranty or extended warranty here in the US. The whole process could take 2-3 weeks. So I returned the laptop back to amazon. The return process was swift and easy. Watch out for the limited one year warranty, there is no way to extend that. I'd suggest looking at the DELL G3 and G5 which was just released which is way better at the same price.Delivery: Very prompt delivery. Came in a Amazon box. The ASUS box inside had two puncture marks (I've attached the photos). Thankfully the deeper puncture mark missed the laptop and went through the cardboard skirting that holds the laptop in place inside its box. The ASUS Laptop box was also placed upside down. If the whole package was kept on the floor the only thing between the ground and the laptop were two sheets of cardboard. All the air filled cushioning material was on the wrong side. It's lucky that USPS handled it carefully and nothing broke on the outside. Still a little worried about the effect that might have had on the HDD.About the laptop:This was just launched like 3 weeks before it was ordered. So I was skeptical about the initial hiccups new range of laptops come with.Pros:1. The keyboard keystrokes are sublime. And its a full sized keyboard with the NumPad. The red backlight comes in three brightness levels and an option to turn it off. (There are issues with the backlight which I've covered in the latter portion which I hope is just a defect in this particular laptop and not the whole range)2. The processor is pretty good. Almost on par with and in some ways better than the i7-7700HQ for anyone confused between the two.3. The graphics card is not that great but for the price of $699 it is sufficiently good.4. The cooling fans are very very effective but insanely noisy. Played Battlefield 3 on ultra settings and after a while the middle section of the keyboard was pretty warm/hot but the WASD area was almost at room temperature. You could feel the negative air pressure pulling air into the fan through the keys in that general area (No Idea if this is a good thing or bad)5. The trackpad has a nice feel to it but a slightly noisy click.6. The speakers are really good!7. Not a lot of preinstalled bloatware.Cons:1. The screen is FHD but just not that good. Like really bad viewing angles. Previously had a 14"" TN screen that I could live with, but on this bigger screen light quantity varies a lot from the top the bottom of the screen.2. The SSHD is slow and isn't the most silent. It makes tiny clunking noises.3. Battery life is really bad. 2-3 hours is the most you can get out of this even on battery saver.4. The fans are really noisy!Stuff that might just be wrong with the device I received and not necessarily the product line:1. The backlight flickers when it is kept at the lowest brightness level. I've attached a video of it too. The flickering you see is not due to the camera but the backlights on the keyboard.2. A portion of the F9 key is not lit up. a part of the LEDs beneath the key are not lighting up.I guess I'll have to contact ASUS regarding this. Really not pleased about this.Overall it is a pretty good laptop for the cost. Another one in this range that might be as durable as this one is DELL insprion 15 5000 gaming. This one just looks way too cooler and was made for gaming.I'll add new stuff as I discover it about this laptop."	3	6	3	8	0
I have noticed how slow the laptop may seem to be, but consider windows 10 is a big OS compared to the earlier versions. Also Hard Drives is slower than Solid State Drives. But is this bad? Not necessarily. You have enough power to game and do light video editing. This is not a workstation gaming laptop costing over $2,000. Tech guys has always been iffy on AMD APUs but after I figure out how to keep software up-to-date, it works wonderful. For me I love this purchase and it works for me. Eventually I might add in an ssd and expand to 16 gb of ram but this is enough for me.So my final verdict is for someone on a budget, this is perfect for light gaming and video editing. For better than this, either spend more for upgrades of this laptop, or go for something dedicated to 24/7 heavy use. Thank you Lenovo and AMD. I am impressed for what I got.Update November 29, 2017: My laptop froze and I know why. Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge was acting wonky. So a heads up. Download current AMD software and CCleaner or a better Cleaner. After CCleaner removes temp files from Microsoft Edge, one day of browsing internet and 1 gigabyte of hard drive space was Microsoft Edge ONLY. So lesson learned, always clean your PC the moment it gets slow. Looking at it, Microsoft Edge and Windows 10 is POWER HUNGRY. I hope Windows 10 improves better in the near future.	3	2	1	8	7
It's causing my husband all sorts of issues, just a few months after purchasing. Working with experts and tech support to try and get it fixed, but it's an annoying, time-consuming process. The computer is also quite heavy to carry around - we should have found one that's lighter weight.	3	9	2	8	3

This is an excellent laptop for the money. If you are in need of a gaming laptop at a budget price without it looking too shouty when you take it to class or work, this fits the bill nicely. While the majority of the models out there had TN displays, I lucked out and got the updated IPS unit. The display is crisp and vibrant with great viewing angles. The battery life is fantastic as well for a gaming laptop. During every day work such as web browsing and video viewing I get about 6-7 hours (1.5 - 2 hours while playing games using the Nvidia 1050). It also maintains a relatively slim form factor for what is packed in it. The plastic body and build quality feel excellent and the rubberized finish on the top and sides is a nice touch and helps you hold on it it. The downside is that being all black with this texture makes it a fingerprint magnet. The speakers are surprisingly great. The best I have experienced on any laptop I have owned. The sub woofer gives audio extra depth and punch with the front facing speakers providing great stereo sound. One thing to keep in mind is that the speakers are highly directional, so if you are setting at off angles some of the stereo effect is lost. Some people complained about touchpad issues, but this was rectified by a quick and easy Dell drive update. I bought the SSHD model which really slogged the whole thing down. I would immediately recommend getting the model with the SSD. I placed the 500gb SSD from my previous laptop in it and now it is lightning fast. The gaming performance is solid with most games on high settings at 1080p running at 45-60 fps depending on the title. Overall I think this is the best laptop I have owned thus far. There may be more powerful options out there but the price vs. performance ratio on this cannot be beat.Pros:-Great bang for the buck (mine was $700)-Sturdy build quality-Contemporary looks-Easy to work on and upgrade (8gb model has an open ram slot, mine has an open m.2 slot, only takes one screw to get in the back)-Good IPS panel-Great thermals, does get loud er under full load but not much more than my desktop. When not under load and with an SSD it is silent-Nice keyboard back light-Great battery life-Great speakersCons-Keys on the keyboard could be slightly bigger. I adjusted quickly but not as nice as my old Lenovo-Stock mechanical 5400rpm SSHD is a sloth-Fingerprint magnet	3	7	2	8	0
I've really enjoyed this product and would've given it a higher rating if it wasn't for a few problems.First, the battery is rather low, having around only 2 hours of active usage. Secondly, the charger is short, which is a annoying combination with the low battery. And lastly, my biggest problem is that it tends to restart from time to time for no reason when you use it for longer periods of time. But the sound system is amazing. It loads at a good speed, and it works fine besides my problems.	3	2	1	8	7
I believe this computer was dropped sometime before I received it. Once I activated the battery and opened Windows to use it, there was a thin white vertical line down the middle of the screen. It doesn't interfere with usage, but I am disappointed with it.	2	0	0	1	5
DO NOT BUY. Dell was great back in 2010. they have gone down hill since. DO NOT BUY. I loved dell and they always did me great until recently. I spent $900 on a touch taptop and it stopped working after a year and 2 days. They were the worst customer service after the 1 year warrenty. Wouldnt do a thing. Had so much faith in dell until now. they set their computers to fail when the warranties are up. DO NOT BUY.	3	9	3	8	0

Bought this laptop knowing the screen wasn't the best. Read the other reviews and thought it couldn't be that bad, well it is but I plan on replacing it down the line and I'm happy with the performance so I'm going to keep it. Ordered the laptop and at the same time I ordered:¬†Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400 MT/S (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory (CT8G4SFS824A)¬†and¬†ADATA SU800 M.2 2280 128GB Ultimate 3D NAND Solid State Drive (ASU800NS38-128GT-C)The upgrade of 8GB memory and the 128GB SSD really makes this a great performing laptop. Did the install before turning the laptop on the first time, took it out of the package, removed one screw, removed the cover plate and installed the SSD and SODIIM, closed it up and fired it up for the first time. The laptop recognized the added memory without any additional steps needed on my behalf. I let the system run it's start up and after it was ready to use I downloaded the image program offered by ADATA on their web site, transferred the drive to the SSD and rebooted, they system automatically recognized the new boot drive, once I confirmed the transfer was good to do I reformatted the 1T hard drive into a storage drive and now have a fast booting system with plenty of memory for $827.94 bucks (Laptop was $709, SSD $55.99 and SODIMM $62.95). Not a bad deal. Watch the prices on Amazon, they go up and down often. Add the parts you want to your cart and save for later or put them in a Wish List. Buy when they hit your price point.Now for the screen, since I started using the laptop I have had headaches, I don't know if it's because I'm using it more than my 7 year old XPS 1703 Dell or if it's because of the screen. I'm going to blame the screen. I plan on swapping it out for an IPS screen like one reviewer constantly points out in his reviews and comments. Reading the how-to it appears to be something I could do easily and the screen was priced at under $70 when I last checked.As for performance, this machine is great, I was able to play Skyrim on max settings, kick some tail on Players Unknown Battlegrounds and effortlessly surf the web with many browser windows open. Great laptop for not a lot of money. Some might say I had to MOD the computer to get this performance and to a point this is true, however I searched and didn't find another machine in this price range with this level of hardware for a comparable price. To me it was well worth the additional effort to make this laptop meet my needs.	3	7	3	8	0
Pros, Good keyboard & trackpad, decent screen, good for almost all games playing on high to meduim settings with 60 fps. Cons, thermals are good for older games but without a cooling pad it runs at 70 degrees c & could overheat when playing for a long time though I haven't had any issues. Overall this laptop is very good. I haven't played a ton of games but what I have & seen is running things like overwatch & Minecraft & some other games it runs good at high settings but starts to dull down when running at ultra but still runs well, Minecraft though runs at fully maxed settings with max draw distance with 100 fps.	3	6	3	3	0
Not impressed. The system is fast but the vast majority of hard space is filled - we‚Äôre getting storage warning after a few days and only installed chrome. Must spend a lot of time setting up and cleaning up.	2	0	0	1	4
I love the Chromebook as a whole. The keyboard is decent, the screen is great. Being able to flip in tablet mode is awesome. All that was great until....... Wifi connection started dropping. In the beginning, I could reset the wifi, and it would work fine. Then it turned into restart the device, and finally, it just wouldn't connect at all. So, I sent it off for repair from Samsung (they do have pretty good customer service I must admit.) They checked it out, and repaired it (apparently replaced the whole motherboard) I get my new one back, and for two weeks it is great, then.... the same issue. I am waiting for my second repair, and crossing my fingers that it is fixed this time. This issue is the only thing about the device that has been a problem, aside from the metal scratching easy, but that is not a huge issue for me.	1	1	0	1	4
The absolute slowest computer I have ever used. Brand new and it takes over 5 minutes to boot. I updated all the drivers and that made it boot about 10 seconds faster. Playing anything on it slows the thing to a crawl. I manage to pull framerates of about 8 sometimes. Buy a potato - it‚Äôll work better than this piece of garbage. I want my money back.UPDATE: computer won‚Äôt even boot up now. DO NOT buy this sack of garbage.	3	7	3	8	0
Microsoft has been really impressive recently‚Äîfirst the Surface Studio and now this gorgeous piece of kit. I‚Äôm a big fan of the latest tech and the Surface Laptop is a ‚Äúmust-have.‚Äù The fancy keyboard material is quite a nice touch and the screen is very clear. Plus it‚Äôs touch screen, which makes Apple‚Äôs touch bar look even more laughable. Recommended for anyone who is disillusioned with the other offerings. Or really anyone who wants a top of the line laptop.	2	8	2	3	3
I cannot stream Netflix or videos on this computer without it dropping the wi-fi signal. There must be something wrong with the wi-fi card. I know the problem isn‚Äôt with my internet service-I bought a Roku and that streams just fine. I bought this laptop when it when it first got listed on Amazon. I wish I had waited to see any reviews listed before buying it. Based on what customers are saying about it, I would not purchase it now.	3	9	2	8	6
the mouse is almost completely unresponsive and makes scrolling or browsing (the main purpose of this laptop) nearly impossible. I am not picky but this is unusable! Do not buy this laptop! I am out of the 30 day return policy otherwise I would return this asap!	2	5	2	3	4
Good very basic business pc. Has minimum amount of RAM for Windows 10 Home. Would not use this one for gaming but good for watching movies and general office work. Only gripe would be to have a higher grade Windows 10 included.	3	9	2	8	3
"***Edit: the first review that you are reading was posted shortly after receving the product. The second one is taken two months later, and I recommend you follow the recent review in comparison. Originally rated 4 stars, now 3.***This the ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 m3-7Y30.Ok, let's start out with the minor faults I have found:For the 14 inch m3, there is no backlit keyboard, no finger sensor, and you are not sent the pen. I feel like Amazon made this very misleading and I find that to be very unfortunate. There are a few different version of this laptop, but I think it's best to differentiate which laptop has these certain perks, and to not advertise like it has all of them. I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard but like I said, it doesn't come on this one.But aside from that, I am so far really enjoying this laptop. It's really beautiful, thin, and light, and I know this will perfectly fit in my backpack without straining my shoulders. The screen is a great size for watching TV shows, movies, and any YouTube video, and I think that will come in really handy. Asus did a superior job with making the bezels much thinner, and it really shows. Ontop of that, the audio is stellar, and I am blown away at the power of the sound that this little thing has! The bass can be heard extremely well, and the speakers on both the left and right sides are rich and full. I've never heard better audio on any laptop before. Finally, the laptop seems to run quite smooth and quick, even when I've got about six or seven tabs open when doing schoolwork. Starting up does not take long either. In terms of the glare, I honestly don't think it's terrible, but if you focus on it, of course it will be noticeable. I don't think it's that bad, and I still think the images appear nicely. Yes, 100% brightness on this type of laptop may not be as bright on either a Mac or even a Samsung Chromebook, but I don't mind since my eyes strain easily from a screen that is too bright. That being said though, viewing in intensely sunny places may not be the best idea. The keyboard types nicely and the touch pad is very smooth. One thing I noticed about Asus laptops from YouTube reviews is that the keyboard is very bouncy, but it is rather firm on here and there is no bounce at all. Touch screen works fine, but lags occasionally here and there. I don't know if it's because it's new, but even when using the touch screen, the screen is still very clean. I'd finally like to add that it is a very silent laptop, and it did heat up while charging, but after removing it, it was fine. Speaking of the charger, it's very convenient since it's small and compact.Overall this is quite the fine laptop for the price, and it's certainly a looker. I only wish that Asus would make laptops that have all of this plus the backlit keyboard in the same price range. I will update my review after a few months or if I find anything wrong with the laptop. For now I recommend this for any student who wants a laptop that can be used for school and entertainment. Also, this is one of the nicest looking laptops out there for a great price. Excited to see what else Asus has to offer, and I really hope they can continue expanding!***2 Months Later*** - 1 Star due to underperforming battery life and pad lagging. The main perk of this laptop is how easily you can move with it. It's light and compact, and that's a huge must for me as a college student walking along campus. The performance hasn't lagged, but I do have issues with the the touch pad (the thing you use for the mouse? Not the screen) being slow and randomly spazing out. Also the dark glare has become bothersome but can I really complain that much? I'm still bothered that Amazon hasn't fixed the description of this product, because I still long for the back lit keyboard when it gets dark, but again, it's a very minor thing that shouldn't drop a star from the door star rating. If there's one thing that should is the battery life. I'm kind of getting tired of technology telling us about this great battery life we're getting, when after doing actual work, we really aren't. Of course I have many tabs open when I work and I will watch YouTube or listen to Spotify, but I still feel like the life could be a lot better than what was advertised. I am pretty sure that I am not the only student who has various tabs/programs open. Concerning the 360 ability of the laptop... I really don't use it. Just to show people ""hey look!"" and that's it. If they charge more for that, that's really ridiculous. I don't use the touch screen too much since I'm not a fan of dirtying my screen, but I suppose it can be helpful when the pad lags. I will say that a good thing about this laptop is that it doesn't take long at all to turn on and the speakers. I'm still highly impressed by these speakers. But with that being said, I'm not sure if I'm going to buy another Asus laptop after this. If you're on a budget I recommend getting this for now, but if you can splurge on something pricier that has better performance then go ahead. It's crazy to say that $600 isn't a lot for a laptop, because if you ask me, that's barely how much I make in a month working part time while going to school full time... While technology has graced us, it has also burdoned us with high costs for an ultimately subpar performance. Unfortunately what can we do? It's a practical necessity as a student to have a stable computer that does x y and z. Nevertheless, I still hope that Asus will continue to improve their products. For now, this is an aesthetically pleasing and compact laptop that performs at a slightly above average performance with some cons that greatly bring it down."	2	9	0	2	4
For the price i can't complain. I got all the specific things i wanted. I am fairly easy to please and dont need much. However, I just dont like the keyboard...not super easy to type.	3	9	2	8	3
"Love this laptop. I'm so sad to see the newer gen laptops that have removed the MicroSD card reader and all the ""normal"" USB ports. This laptop has been rock solid. I'm running Linux Mint on it and it works perfectly. The keyboard is perfect - especially the arrow keys (the newer models cram the four arrow keys together in a very un-user-friendly way, but this model has a great keyboard.) The matte screen is exactly what I wanted. I absolutely didn't want a touch screen, they waste battery and you end up with a screen covered in fingerprints and one that reflects everything behind you, making it difficult to get work done.All in all, this was a great purchase. Thank you Asus for providing a great laptop for Linux users!"	2	6	5	4	3
Very good item, sleek easy to use, very light. Design is very good.Down side bit slow for an i5 from the beginning, also there is this irritating fan/ hard disk spinning noise(like its out of place). It‚Äôs pertinent with all of these model not just with mine that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs manufactured I checked it and even other reviews say that.Battery backup is not as expected I think it doesn‚Äôt even last of what is claimed.	2	6	3	8	3
"For my purposes, this is the best Windows laptop under $1,500 right now. I bought this laptop about three months ago and it has been my regular machine for work. I am absolutely not going back to the old work laptop (HP 820 G3) and don't think I'd take the other Surface offerings.Things I adore:The 3:2, high-resolution touchscreen is hands down the best screen for getting things done on the go. This blows the prison issue HP Elitebook 820 G3's 16:9 screen out of the water, and, to my untrained eye, is as bright and precise as my 2017 Macbook Pro (used for home use - I like separation of church and state). The 3:2 aspect ratio is magical for the usual trio of Outlook, Excel, and Word.Things I like:In terms of form factor - this reminds me a lot of an older Macbook Air. It's just about the right size, and is featherweight. I'm satisfied with battery life, speakers, and performance. Docking (with one exception, mentioned below in the ""things I hate"" section) is easy and works every time.Things I don't like:The keyboard (lots of pressure necessary to type - much prefer a ThinkPad up to and including T420 keyboard), and general surroundings in alcantara. One of my cars has an alcantara headliner and pillars - which is great because I never touch them. The gray alcantara is begging to get dirty and I think I'm already seeing a bit of a shadow where my right palm rests.Would love a second USB type A port, and would love to have a Windows laptop that doesn't have coil whine. There's a hint of it if the room's silent - nothing like the Dell XPS 13 tried out and ended up returning last year.Things I hate:I'm forced to run a custom Windows 10 Enterprise image and I have scaling problems. My two external monitors are connected via a Surface Dock - two Planar specials at 1440p. I run the laptop at 125% scaling, and the monitors at 100%. No matter which Surface display/dock/whatever driver update I perform, I still have issues upon docking and undocking, that requires me to log out and log back in."	2	8	2	3	3
"I bought this Asus Notebook with the impression that it would have 32GB of storage as it was advertised. Before I have even uploaded all of my pictures from my 32GB phone, the computer storage is COMPLETELY full, with a whopping 10.9GB allotted to ""System&Reserved"". I would qualify this as being a gross overstatement of this computers specifications. I am thoroughly displeased."	2	0	0	1	5
Well I decided to upgrade from my 650$ Dell Inspiron and am starting to regret it. Other than the 120hz screen, there is not a noticeable difference in performance. On top of that, There is a very annoying buzzing sound like one you'd hear during an AOL connection or something . I couldn't tell you where its coming from but I know its not the fans. All in all, If you're going to spend this much money on a laptop, don't spend it on this one.	3	7	5	8	0
Really enjoy this laptop‚Äôs blend of features: it‚Äôs beautifully designed without being fragile, the touchscreen is a useful option, and it‚Äôs quite thin and lightweight. Immediately used the free upgrade to Windows pro 10. No complaints!	2	7	2	3	3
It does not come with any adapters to convert the smaller ports (micro usb and usb-c) to standard usb ports. The viewing angles is pretty bad, about 90 degrees total left to right or up to down (45 degree from center any direction) loses color then coherency.	2	9	0	2	4
Horrible on space. You will get a low storage message within a week of using this laptop. Its good for access to Microsoft office and the internet , but it serves no other purpose. Save your money if your looking for a serious business laptop. This is not it.	2	0	0	1	2
Computer is less than 6 months old and hard drive failed, the tel number They have on Amazon to call doesn't work. They cant even get the model number or the serial number and HP Says they can not help with out the serial number and they cant find that because the hard drive is not working. I will say that Amazon Just confirmed that they will take it back and refund my money.	4	6	4	8	3
This laptop works great, the only issue I have is the the screen is pretty flexible other than that it works great. Also a heads up on future buyers it will not read the Nvidia out of the box you must configure it to load off of it or it will use the intigrated Intel graphics (and we all know what that's like) but once it's configured it can run just pretty much anything fluctuating between 45-60fps but because it is a 1050 I recommend getting a laptop docking fan because it will get hot over long term use. Otherwise great product Acer	3	6	5	8	0
"Bought as a replacement for a 10 year old Lenovo T500 at work. Positives: Screen, price. Boot-up time is much better after deleting bloatware. Google ""How to remove windows 10 bloatware"". It's not the lightest, fastest or most power efficient laptop, but at $250 (1/4 the price of a phone) it does a great job."	3	1	0	8	2
Had this machine for 24 hours and had to return it for a refund. All kinds of problems. It was extremely slow (took 30 minutes just to start). Constantly making a loud noise; couldn't install or uninstall programs (finally had to do a factory reset); files that I transferred were corrupted and couldn't be opened on the new machine; battery was halfway drained an hour after unplugging (are they using old batteries?). Very disappointed.	3	5	4	9	3
I'm a computer science student so having a PORTABLE laptop is essential. I really made an investment in this because it's a lot more expensive than my original price point but this laptop has everything I needed.The laptop is slim and super light so it's extremely portable.The battery lasts for FOREVER. I took this to a hackathon and at one point I was away from my charger and it lasted in power save mode for at least 3-4 hours after it got below 25%. It would have lasted longer but I plugged it in as soon as I could.The screen is awesome. I noticed a lot of the reviews before I bought this complained about the screen being too dim but for me its perfect. It's not extremely bright which really saves your eyes if you're up until midnight writing some code :^)Also, the i5 8th gen processor makes this laptop worth every penny.	2	5	2	3	4
Very nice computers however, we needed these units to complete PDF Fillable forms. Chrome is the only browser option available and is not compatible. These units needed to be returned & replaced with computers that support Internet Explorer. Buyer beware if this is your need as well.	3	1	0	0	2

"After reading numerous reviews between this, a comparable Lenovo, and the HP Stream 11, I bought the ASUS.I own both a high-end ASUS desktop machine, and also an early 2016 ASUS UX305 laptop. Both are great machines, and I put them through the grind on a daily basis. That said, I'm not ""brand loyal"" by any stretch of the imagination.I came to Amazon via a PC Magazine breakdown of the best budget laptops for 2017. I was intentionally looking for a full Windows 10 laptop in the smallest weight and physical size footprint I could get, for the least amount of money. I knew I didn't want a Chromebook, but wanted the cheapest step up from that which I could. The reason for this has to do with some of the places I travel to, both domestically (USA) and internationally. Basically, I wanted something bare bones that I could use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint from, send email, and write blog posts, but that was cheap enough that I wouldn't cry if it was either stolen on a train in Europe (been there, done that) or demolished by a 70-foot drop down a ravine.Even though the specs on this computer are slightly lower than both the Lenovo and HP Stream I was looking at, I opted for this machine based solely on physical size and weight. It's just a smidge under 1kg, and had the smallest physical dimensions.Received it today and immediately went to work on uninstalling the bloatware and disabling as much of the Windows 10 junk as possible. If you are not tech savvy, there are a number of tools that will help you with this process. I personally used the Winaero Tweaker to get rid of most of the Microsoft spyware and other stuff. Despite my dislike of the new Office 365 system, I went ahead and activated the complimentary 1 year Office 365 membership -- a nice perk that would normally cost $70 (thus making this a $130 laptop, if you squint real hard).With a dozen Chrome tabs open, another application installing, and a giant update downloading all at the same time... Sure, it slows to a crawl. But it was tolerable. Mine was manufactured in April 2017 (mfg date is on the sticker on the bottom of the unit), and I doubt I would have been as thrilled with the early 2016 version that only had 2 GB of RAM and a slightly older processor.Sure, the screen ain't the best, and it will grind to a halt if you try doing audio or video editing probably, but that's not what it's for. My ASUS UX305 with an Intel i-5 processor does near real-time video rendering -- this E200HA ain't going to do that, and I would never ask it to (ok, I'm a nerd, so I might try it just for kicks).For the average home user doing basic word processing and web surfing, this machine is perfectly adequate. I'm a ""power user"" of sorts, and am co-founder of a small tech startup, so know a thing or two about computers even though I'm not an IT professional or ""coder"". This is the machine I would buy if I had a kid at any grade level, including college. It's the laptop I would buy for my mother if, for some reason, she needed something more powerful than her iPad. This is the laptop that I will take with me in the RV and over to Europe over the next few months and not be too worried about it growing legs or falling overboard into the English Channel.It's a great little piece of technology for $200, and will fit the needs of most American consumers. Dial down your expectations, and you won't be disappointed. If you simply need more horsepower, then I'd suggest looking at the current ASUS line in the $600-$800 price range, because that's what you'll need to spend for far superior performance."	2	0	0	1	5

I receive this chromebook on 7/7. it a great portable device that I have been using everyday to browser, school work and watch video on. The problem i have with it is, that the wifi connection speed will drop and if watching video or browsering, the laptop does get warm near the hinge.	1	1	0	1	4
I really like this laptop. It has a great screen and offers good web browsing experience. After installing Office 2016 and applying the latest Windows and Office updates I still have 11 GB free on the C: drive. So it's not as bad as some other reviewers described it. Performance is also satisfactory both when browsing, streaming content or working with Office.Definitely recommend it.	2	0	0	1	2
"So I bought this because my toshiba laptop that I been having for 4years charger port broke and I didn't feel like fixing it. But guess what ""ILL BE FIXING IT"". I read reviews prior to getting this laptop I seen some negatives and positives and I went on and got it because there was more positive reviews. LONG STORY SHORT. THE LAPTOP RESPONSE SLOWWWWW, and IT CAME WITH A VIRUS. So I'm returning it !! Disappointed !!"	2	0	0	1	5
Arrived early and as expected from EXcaliberPC. They did awesome. But, after 2 weeks the HDD failed. I meticulously took care of this, it was only used on a desk and kept in the box when not in use. I am in the process of getting the RMA done. Apparently I have to pay for shipping one way and it will leave me without a computer for 30+ days. That is a BUMMER. I did not abuse this thing, it was a defective item. Yet I have to pay for shipping and wait for them to OPEN it up, poke around and hopefully fix it. I would rather just get a new one since this had problems right out of the gate. I have always heard good things about MSI. I guess I will see how this works out for me because I feel pretty let down and may try other brands next time.	4	8	3	8	0
Overall great machine for a good price. Excellent build quality. Excellent sound. Keyboard backlit...awesome!Mine did not come with a power cable from wall outlet to charger/adapter.Display/Screen clarity could be better.	3	6	2	3	3
i purchased this computer because i missed pc gaming so badly, and didnt want a desktop. this computer is amazing! play pub g on ultra over 60fps, and any other game you can think of on ultra. the monitor is great, keyboard kicks ass (and looks cool). yea its heavy and big, but what do you expect with a 17 inch gaming laptop with a 1070 in it??? highly recommend! if you can afford the 1080 why not?? i use this thing almost everyday.	4	7	5	8	0
I have had this for two weeks now. This is my fourth Chromebook and 2nd touch screen. So far, this is my favorite. I loved the size of the Acer C100 touch screen but this is almost as light. The screen is wonderful. Other people are more expert at explaining the details than I am but I like that it is small and light enough to comfortably travel with and has a beautiful screen for watching movies. My husband bought one too and he has no complaints either.	1	1	0	1	4
"I wanted to like this unit, but the experience was a negative one for me. As usual there is blame on both sides, but there were some issue that I had not been expecting, especially on the interface side of the equation. The unit itself is light and the design was really excellent. It certainly showed well. I did like the flexibility that the S-pen delivered. The screen was a little odd due to the 4x3 orientation, but I did expect that from what I read about it prior to purchasing it. It still was a bit off putting from my perspective. The operation of the unit was slower than what I expected, especially when accessing the Internet or downloading apps or files. However some real show stoppers for me were its size and the Chrome interface.I was not ready for the size of the unit and the cumbersome process for converting the unit from a PC-like device to a tablet. As a PC device it was fine, but the process of folding the unit backwards on itself was slow and cumbersome. I kept thinking that I was going to drop it on the floor during this operation. I also had some concerns of the longevity of the hinges on the unit. How long would it be before one of them broke or malfunctioned from the PC to tablet conversion? Lastly, when I had the unit in tablet configuration, it was difficult to gripping the unit. The keys on the keyboard did not help me stabilize the unit.My second big issue was the Chrome interface. Yikes, it is bad. It certainly does not seem like a step forward to me. Each time I wanted to access an app I had to go back out to the main screen, open the main app menu, then find the menu I wanted. It is a huge extra step in my opinion, especially when I was ""upgrading"" from a tablet. Many processes that I use to navigate on a tablet are lacking on this interface."	1	1	0	1	4
Cosmetically, this computer looks brand new and is so sleek! As far as functionality, even better. Connected to my printer in under 2 minutes and starts up and connects to sites quickly. Nice big screen and lightweight. Very happy with this purchase and for the price this is a great deal. Highly recommend.	3	1	0	0	2
First off, the laptop runs really well and runs my Steam library pretty well, and is generally pretty snappy when navigating the desktop. However, the trackpad feels a little weird/slow to me (I'll probably get used to it soon), and if the screen is tilted at the wrong angle, the lighting and colors are way off. Other than that though, it's a solid laptop, definitely an upgrade from the Lenovo Y510P that has somehow made it with me all the way through college.Really the only reason this didn't get a 5 star review is because a week after I got the computer, my I kept on getting a crash loop to the BSOD telling my I had a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error, and I couldn't use my computer for more than 30 seconds before it crashed again. I pulled out my old laptop (I'm currently writing this review on it) and looked up how to re-seat the RAM to see if it had been jostled loose or something, but even when I switched which slot it was in I kept on having crashes due to memory. LUCKILY, my boy Mohammed over at Dell support was on the phone with me while I was messing around in the chassis and Dell is sending me a new RAM stick free of charge. I'm a little bummed I won't be using my laptop for about a week but at least the customer support is good.I still would suggest getting this laptop. Just be aware that this might be an issue, might be worth ordering another 8GB of RAM with the computer and then returning it for free later if you don't need it. Have a good one people, happy shopping.	3	9	3	8	0
This product has several downfalls. One of those is that there is no disk drive installed. Another downfall is that there is no way to increase the storage space. And for what, over $200? Pretty cheap if you ask me. I would not recommend this to anyone.	2	0	0	1	2
I'll never go back to anything less than i7 processor and a ssd. Replaced a 4 year old Lenovo i5, what a huge difference in speed! Restarts are so quick, fit and function of this Asus is great. Price is excellent for this level of computing. I use a voice recognition program which is buggy and demanding and this computer handles it like a champ. I do wish Asus was clearer about which computers use which chargers as I always buy a backup charger for home use. It's tough to match from the item description, but I found one for this. Very happy.	3	9	3	8	1
"Hey everyone....this laptop rocks....it is seriously awesome! I don't understand what other users are moaning about. I've read through other comments before buying and some were complaining about it being noisy, or too hot....I've experienced nothing like it. After playing fornite for 3 hours straight the laptop is barely even warm.....far from hot....the fan is on but it is very quiet....I,ve set the game setting to ""epic"" quality and still getting easy 60 frames per second. The HD is definitely NVME....super fast...the laptop boots in 5 seconds....I am vey happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!"	3	6	3	3	0
"This laptop, out of the box, trumps my 3yo desktop, that I so lovingly built.It has some issues. Namely, it runs hot.Get a cooling stand. Don't expect to use this on battery power for more than an hour. Way less if you do something graphics intensive. This is, for all intents and purposes, a portable lower end gaming desktop. The specs are really great for a mid-range gaming laptop. It's run everything I've thrown at it, and it's heaven benchmark on extreme was around 1200.It's a great, very light weight machine. It's so power hungry though. If you need portable, but always have the ability to plug in, this is exactly what you need.I'd invest in a bag for a 17 inch laptop however, because it's still larger than a standard 15.6"""	3	7	2	8	0
Mine was properly sealed and a new one. and it was dell inspiron 13- 5000 having a touch pad i think it was an upgraded one from dell.since everything was at the right place and nothing wrong. mine had a nice case and the keyboard was backlitting. but as you can see in other reviews as well it has a bit of heating up problem so please be aware of it when you purchase it.Actually im useing it now and it heat ups quite a lot and has a quite big noise.	2	6	3	3	3
Comouter takes forever to load after less than a week of use. Keys have to be pressed harder than normal to type. Dont get this if you type fast or light. Messes up all of my assignments for school so i have to type the same sentence like 3 times to get it all the way.	0	0	0	0	4
Love this laptop.I had a Surface Pro, but hated it due to the small screen size, small battery, and substandard keyboard. This laptop takes all the best features of the Surface Pro and adds to it. Sleek and slim form factor. Spectacular screen. Good battery life. The only slight knock is a lack of ports, but this isn't an important factor for me.	2	7	2	3	3
Its a great machine but has a 1 hour battery life if playing a game some games stress the gpu out and the memory runs at max fairly often but other than those small issues its perfect for its price	3	8	3	8	0
As an experienced Windows 10 user, this laptop was absolutely beyond my expectations after I purchased it. I've had it for almost 3 months and the performance is amazing. It's very fast even on slower internet speeds, and weighs very little with a very sleek design. I can store almost anything with the storage capabilities. I rated this laptop 5 stars because I couldn't imagine anything better. The only thing I would change if I could is the quality of the webcam. It's low pixel and not the best for video chatting. The speakers are okay with adequate bass. I've only had Dell laptops before but I will definitely be purchasing Asus again in the future.	3	7	2	8	4
This is my second Lenovo and it does not disappoint. The only thing I don't like about it is the placement of the right hand shift key. To save space on the keyboard, they put this shift key to the right of the page up key. I have short fingers and small hands, so this makes it difficult for me to reach the right shift key.	3	1	0	7	5
"I bought this laptop for a family member that basically surfs the web and does some light Office suite work. The performance is pretty good; it seems quick and not a lot of lag. As far as the hard drive space goes, that is easily resolved with the addition of an external SD card to provide more space. So from a performance standpoint I would recommend this laptop.My cons are with Microsoft (big surprise, huh?). The 14"" model comes with Windows 10 S, which is Microsoft's ""Big Brother"" version of the operating system that does not allow you to load any third party applications (i.e. - Google Chrome) that are not sanctioned by the Microsoft store. No problem, it comes with a free upgrade to Win10 Pro which allows you to load apps. So I performed the upgrade. After the upgrade and verification it was running Win10 Pro I still could not load apps because Device Guard was still active. So I followed the directions online from Microsoft to disable Device Guard then rebooted the laptop. IT BRICKED THE OPERATING SYSTEM!!! (NOTE: Not 100% sure if this was because of the changes I made or one of the KB updates that does not play well with AMD processors). So, after 2 hours of resetting the OS I'm finally running Win 10 Pro and I am able to load apps. So, buy this if you are happy just running MS authorized applications, or if you want to fight with Microsoft over the right to load any third party software, and spend hours trying to upgrade and make changes to group policy and installed MS components. Lastly, the laptop did not come with Office loaded. When I clicked on the ""Get Office"" link off the start menu it returns an error message that a specific DLL was not found and to re-install the application (re-install and application that was not installed in the first place???). Then after the reset I clicked on the link and it took me to the MS site to BUY OFFICE365!! I'm still fighting with this one."	2	0	0	1	5
I've been seeing a lot of bad reviews and wanted a chance to give a positive opinion. Coming from a Nexus 9 tablet this has been a great experience. While I've only owned this device for 2 days i'm extremely happy with it. As soon as I powered the device on I had 1 update to do which gave me Android App support right after that. Browsing is great, the keyboard feels nice, the apps work as intended although some apps were designed for phones so you wont be able to full screen. If your looking for a device for basic web browsing, watching shows and doing some word docs this is an awesome device. I don't think it will completely replace a laptop but it comes pretty close at least for me it does. The stylus pen also surprising writes pretty well. Even wit the ARM processor i haven't noticed any lag with the things I've been using this for so overall I think its a great buy. I do agree with most 449 might be a little high in price but considering that high end android tablets go for high 300s, I would recommend this device over those and depending on when you reading this i got mines on sale for $350 so it was definitely worth is.	1	1	0	1	4
I love how lightweight this is and the display is fantastic. Still waiting for good pen apps and some Android apps don't work very well, but others, especially video streaming apps, work great!	1	1	0	1	4
"My review will cover pros and cons to help others determine whether given the brand and retail price point of $450, this is a worthy purchase. Note I bought the Samsung CB+ device for $350.Cons:*Overall: A bit shocked by the issues noted below given the notoriety of the Samsung and Google brands and the pricing of the CB+. At $450 I would say the device is not worth the price, but since I got it for $350, I'm on the fence about keeping it. I suppose at $350 or less I'm willing to tolerate these nuisances given the pros.1. Trackpad Sensitivity is Weak - My prior laptop was a MacBook Air which had a superior trackpad, so perhaps this is what you get for $450. I find it slow to react to a light touch, especially if you are one who relies on tapping versus clicking. You can increase the speed of the cursor, but you can't increase the sensitivity of the actual trackpad to react to being touching lightly or hard. I imagine this inferior trackpad is due to this device also being touchscreen - can't complain if you can just touch the screen.**update - determined the trackpad has a bit of a ""dead zone"" around the left and right edges. Doesn't respond to touch until about 0.5 to 1 inch in from the left and right.2. Caps Lock Button Missing - There is no caps lock button. There is a Google Search button in it's place. You must use the shortcut Alt+Search to enable caps lock and hit Shift to turn it off. This significantly slows down typing for me and am having difficulty retraining my brain not to hit the Search button. Typing this review I've hit it at least 10 times already accidentally. Seems silly to get rid of caps lock given this is how every keyboard is configured. It's like swapping the q and m buttons. There are volume buttons at the top of the keyboard and on the side of the device with the power button. Instead of having 2 sets of volume buttons, they could have kept caps lock and moved the search button to the space at the top occupied by the second set of volume buttons.3. Unlock is Inconsistent - Your options are to unlock with Google password, Smartlock via your phone Bluetooth, or a Pin. Your options to login are your Google Password or Smartlock. I find that even coming from unlock (not login) the CB+ doesn't always present the option to enter a Pin. I'd say I'm probably given the option to enter my Pin 50% of the time. On top of that, it takes several minutes before it finds my phone, even when BT is enabled and the phone on top of the CB+. Sometimes it doesn't find the phone at all. If you have a complex Google password be prepared to login to your password manager to retrieve it every time you want to login to your CB+.4. Extensions Slow Down Browsing - I only have 3 extensions and have noticed significant slow down in pages loading which I never experienced on the MacBook Air.5. Apps Not Optimized for CB+ - I find that many apps don't seem quite compatible with this device. For example, VPN extension works great while the same VPN app does nothing.6. Adobe Flash - Occasionally encounter issues with Flash sites not loading that I've never had before on other devices.7. Backspace Next to Lock Button - The backspace button is very short and is directly under the lock button. This is poor placement of a button that will lock your computer to place it next to a commonly used button. I've accidentally locked my CB+ when trying to backspace.8. CB+ Hard Case - Samsung does not offer a hard case accessory for this device. The hard case by iPearl sold on Amazon prevents the device from fully folding into tablet mode.9. Speakers Weak - You probably need an external Bluetooth speaker if not casting to a TV.10. Random Issues - Certain tabs will go fully black with bands of white through it. Randomly had the whole screen freeze for several minutes. Closed and re-opened screen twice until it appeared to re-boot. Again CB+ did not find phone via Bluetooth to utilize Smartlock and proceeded to indicate Bluetooth was turned off. Upon finally logging back in, I confirmed Bluetooth was on the whole time.Pros:*Overall - I love the versatility of the device being reversible, touchscreen, and the built-in pen. Given I primarily need a device for internet browsing and casting videos, this meets my needs.1. Reversible - Easily convert from laptop to a tablet. Use the keyboard to prop it on a table in a shape like this: ^ or this: _\.2. Touchscreen - Easily navigate between apps, chrome tabs, etc. with touchscreen in laptop or tablet config.3. Pen - Create screenshots or hand written notes/drawings with the pen.4. Apps/Extensions - Choose between installing Google Play apps, using Chrome Web store extensions, or links to regular web apps.5. Cloud - Store and sync your notes, documents, pictures, etc to Google Drive and access it from your other devices.6. Chromecast - Cast tabs and videos with your Google Chromecast using extension or Google Home app.7. Swype - Touchscreen keyboard already enable to recognize Swype entry."	1	1	0	1	4
Excellent product - Lightweight, great battery. the only reason for a 4 star is I wish they had a model with more memory and larger hard drive. I'd buy that also! Otherwise, no complaints!	2	5	2	3	3
When I bought this computer, I was under the impression Window was included. WINDOWS IS NOT INCLUDED! Other than that, it is a great computer.So not only is Windows NOT included with this computer but I've had it for less than 2 months and now the battery isn't charging. It will only work if it is plugged in & immediately dies when you unplug it because it will NOT charge the battery.	3	9	2	8	3
Have had the laptop now for about a week and love it. Use it for browsing, listening to music, programming, and school work. The look and feel remind me a lot of my old 2011 Macbook Pro. If you're going to get this laptop, you absolutely must pay the extra cost for the SSD combo as that what makes this a really good deal.	3	7	3	8	3
Computer is ok. Feels cheap plastic but nice having a huge touchscreen and a large keyboard. Took over 9 hours to download initial Windows update but for basic usage it's going to be ok I hope.	3	9	3	9	3

I bought one of these because I normally love Google/Samsung and love my Android phone. I‚Äôm not a fan of Apple so I don't think their products are better than the Chromebook - I hate Apple products probably equally as much as I hated my Chromebook which I returned after discovering it‚Äôs useless for my purposes. I realized that it's basically like a large mobile phone, and you can't access certain websites, at least not the desktop version of websites, and this was an absolute deal breaker for me. Even if there is an app available, its usually very limited. I wanted to install the Brave browser and all I could get for it was an app which was extremely limited and wouldn't let me use the extensions I want. Instead it's better to buy a Rasberry Pi and run Rasberrian on it because they have about the same amount of power. In fact the Pi is better in many ways. For example, the Pi is only 1/10 the price, takes up less space, is more energy efficient, can access desktop versions of websites, run desktop apps, has an ethernet port and with this useless Chromebook I had to waste money on a multi-port hub adapter for $120 which I will probably donate to charity. Don't make the same mistake as me thinking you can install Linux onto it or boot from it off a thumb drive. It‚Äôs not that easy and wasn‚Äôt worth the struggle of trying IMO. The people saying it‚Äôs easy are talking about doing it on the regular Chromebook with the Intel chip. Although they're fast, I feel Intel chips are less secure these days and I'm shifting more of my systems to ARM. I was going to try installing crouton until I found out that it‚Äôs being deprecated and apparently Google plans to stop making the Chromebook altogether and change the Chrome OS into a hybrid of Android and Chrome OS. Another big reason to avoid all versions of the Chromebook.	1	1	0	1	4
Very Happy with the Product. I received the laptop without touchscreen. Laptop itself is in great condition, Looks new. Battery lasts little over 3 hours. Bought this for my son and he is very happy with the laptop	1	7	2	3	4
I bought a referbed one from another site and have been using for over a month now... holy cow it is awesome. Best laptop I‚Äôve ever used hands down. Plays Wow, Fortnite no problems at all.

"Where do I even start with this thing? It's so nice, literally, have your friend pick it up and watch their face. They will be amazed at how light it is. Then show them the benchmarks...and mention the battery life. This laptop has made my mind blow.Display:The display is very vibrant, even though it's nowhere close to being OLED, the blacks are very deep, and everything is very vibrant. Not sure how color accurate it is, but man it looks awesome. It's 1080p, which is totally fine, it's only 13.3"" and you only see pixels if you put your face up to the screen. The bezels are very small, which makes it seem super futuristic. It doesn't get super bright, but for me, that isn't too big of a deal. I came from a 2014 13"" MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display, and it's not quite 'Retina' quality, but that's why this gets 12 hours of battery and the Mac gets 5.Design:Personally, if I had to make the purchase again, I'd opt for the gray one. The white is very pretty, but it's less than a week old at this point and it is a little dirty already. Not a huge deal as I wipe it down when I see a smudge, but just make sure to always have handy wipes available if you want your laptop to look good. The overall look isn't gaudy, and nobody will recognize it from a distance, but man the 'gram' insignia on the lid looks classy. Like really good. The plastic bezel is okay, not my favorite, but what are you gonna do?Build Quality:The display flexes A LOT! Like you're not ready for it. However, other than that, it feels premium, yet cheap at the same time. When you take the laptop out of your bag for the first time of the day, you'll feel the cold metal, but then you start to feel that it's plastic. The Nano-Carbon Magnesium Alloy is nice, however, it can be felt as plastic, which is the carbon layer on top of the magnesium. Not a huge deal, but something you might want to watch out for.Battery:It's crazy long, crazy crazy. I unplug it at 6:45 AM and use it all day until about 4 PM and it's only at 40%. I'm so not even sure how they made it so good. It's 72 Wh, which is huge, especially for a laptop that's so small and that only has a 1080p display. Most other laptops at this price point and especially ones that are this thin and light don't even come close to the battery life of this thing.Performance:The new 8th-gen Core processors are just awesome. They have very little power draw, yet they're super powerful. My old Mac had a 4th-generation dual-core i7. This thing more than doubled the performance of that, it's incredible. The 8GB of ram gets used up quickly, so I'd recommend upgrading to 16GB by yourself, just buy another 8GB SODIMM on Amazon, and pop it in yourself.Keyboard & Trackpad:The keyboard is pretty good, a bit mushy, but personally, I prefer this. The trackpad is using Windows Precision drivers, which makes it very usable. It feels natural, not quite as good as the Mac trackpad, but honestly way better than I would have thought. LG really hit it out of the park on this keyboard/trackpad combo.Verdict:Absolutely pick up this laptop if you're a performance enthusiast and someone who wants a 2lb laptop that has enough power for the day and enough battery to let you work for more than 12 hours straight. Buy one, now. You won't regret it. I promise."	2	5	2	3	3

I've only had this laptop for a few days, so at some point I may come back and update this review. However, for now I wanted to give a review based on my experience after first using the computer. Right out of the box this thing ran slower than a 3 year old Samsung Satellite that I picked up on here for about $500.This Asus was so brutally slow out of the box it took me 2.5 hours to install Adobe Creative Suite from an installer I downloaded! Even before the install it would take almost 2 minutes to open Windows and launch any software.Before I did a return I decided to re-install Windows. After the the computer ran like a normal computer. Although it still seemed a little slow for an i7 with 8 gigs of RAM. But, overall everything is running much better.So it looks like whatever software ASUS is pre-installing on this thing is terrible. Please ASUS do something about your pre-loaded software. Your laptops are rated pretty highly, but something like this is terrible!	3	9	3	8	1
Very happy with this comparatively inexpensive laptop. Inexpensive when compared to other souped up gamer models. This has more juice than I would have expected for the price. The display is nice, the speed is better than I had anticipated (so far). The hard driver is not huge and an inexpensive external hard drive would make a perfect complement to this purchase.	3	6	3	3	0
I wanted to use my new chromebook for a couple of weeks before I reviewed it. I honestly though the Plus would work well for me, and for the most part it does. However, I have managed to crash it once or twice by having too many apps/tabs open at once. Other than that, it is very functional for me. I enjoy being able to use some of the same apps I have on my smartphone on my chromebook. Its fairly fast, very light, has a great screen and keyboard, and I really like the stylus. I've not used it in tablet mode often but like it when I do. This is a really good machine if you mainly spend time surfing the web, playing games, and light work in Google Drive.	1	1	0	1	4

If your Surface device goes bad after warranty you are out of luck. I have a surface 3 that started having issues after 21 months of use. It was not abused. There is no repair service just a replacement charge of $320.00! This for a device that new was 500.00. This is completely absurd. If your Surface Book goes bad after 12 months it will be $600.00 to get it replaced and no option to get it repaired.Microsoft has reliability issues as documented by Consumers Report with 25 % of users having issues by the end of the second year. According to Consumers Reports this is much higher than other manufactures. My experience with Dell was much better for an out of warranty defect. They replaced a laptop that had a motherboard issue at no cost.My Surface 3 mini displayport does not work and it also has an issue with every USB device disconnecting then connecting again 5 times a minute when connected to the dock. This means it is continuously chirping unless I turn the sound down. I wonder what is next. Evidently Microsoft thinks this is normal.Microsoft Technical Support people have been prolite but totally useless offering no troubleshooting knowledge that I didn‚Äôt already know.Out-of-warranty service fees by product‚Äì United States (currency US-USD)Surface Pro 3 $599.00Surface 3 $310.00Surface 3 (LTE) $310.00Surface Pro 4 $450.00Surface Book $599.00Surface Studio $899.00Surface Laptop $450.00Surface Pro (latest) $450.00	2	7	2	3	3
"I know we all don't like to read negative reviews because we want this product to be the ""one"" after hours of comparing and contrasting but based on our experience with this laptop, I must give it a ONE star. Usually I don't write reviews but this is extremely disappointing because I always saw Lenovo as a budget friendly quality product. We bought this laptop for simple tasks such as browsing for products on the web and create basic excel sheets. It did not happen without any frustration. It took forever for the laptop to operate. We were actually deciding between this Lenovo and the Acer Aspire but decided on this one due to the 8GB of RAM. It was a bad decision purchasing this laptop because the computer would freeze as if it was a 5 year old laptop. Websites took MINUTES to load completely and the same goes for opening any application.I do use a Lenovo tower at home and it is magnificent, I wish I can say the same about this Laptop."	3	2	1	8	7
The item arrived just as pictured. The look and feel is great. The surfaces are covered in a soft rubber that makes if feel comfortable to rest your palm or wrist on and also provide better grip than the normal plastic material most laptops come with at this price range. For a gaming oriented laptop it is definitely more on the sleek end of the style spectrum and the red accents are a darker in colour. The mousepad and keys are very responsive. I have fairly large hands and the smaller keys are still not an issue, although the direction keys are the smallest I have seen on any keyboard layout and could be bigger in my opinion.Specs wise, I researched fairly extensively, and for the 699 deal I got this laptop for there was nothing that could match. No system on any major retailer I could find had a laptop with an i7-7700 and a 1050 at 700 unless it did not have windows installed. For the 899 regular price there are certainly competitive options, but if it's on sale again I'm sure you will not be disappointed. I don't have a great gaming reference as far as super demanding games, but playing some WoW since I picked it up I have managed to stay at 70-100+ fps at near max graphic settings.	3	9	3	8	0
Absolutely phenomenal laptop for a low price. I code on this thing just fine for small simple programs. I got a USB HDD along with it so when I get something big going on it I can save it on the hard drive and run it later on the big machine. It plays Civ 5 like a charm on low settings, and a few other random games mostly pretty 'lowend' stuff(and Dwarf Fortress). Web browsing in chrome can feel sluggish at times, on that note though I feel as if the NIC really does its job well.Pros:- Small sleek design- Pretty awesome battery, I went something like 4 hours one day on Civ 5 without having to plug it in.- good keyboard. tactile, not mushy at all, and well spaced keys.- Low heatNeutral:- The touchpad works, no qualms with it at all.- The screen is all you can really imagine.- The weight is fineCons:- The only real 'con' I can think of is the speakers, but I mean we have headphones nowadays.	2	0	0	1	5

"It doesn't look like much closed, and it has a very lightweight, plastic feel which makes me question how durable it might be if carried around and moved a lot. The lightweight construction does make it comfortable and easy to carry. It is a nice, big, full-size laptop that seems like a great model to send off to college with a responsible student. There is nothing obviously ""gamer"" looking about the unit until it is opened, and then the blue light of the neon blue keyboard looks ultra cool.The keyboard is shallow but easy to get used to, and the mousepad is not so large that it is hard to do simple things with. (I have found some gaming keyboards have touchpads so large that it is hard to copy and paste quickly, for example.)The display looks nice when watching movies in high def, and the performance when streaming high definition movies is awesome. It has plenty of power for doing graphics and video editing. Gameplay for me is smooth and even, though I typically only play roleplaying and puzzle games at full screen. The audio is a decent volume to hear if watching movies or videos, but headphones or bt speaker are needed for any decent volume to share or for an immersive experience.It does come ready for wireless network connection, but it has a wired port for LAN parties, or possibly for travel needs.It does have hdmi2, and it has a C port, so I am thinking that I might collect a video capture card to it and use it for streaming on Twitch. I love that it is quick to charge, and that fully charged, it is lasting me over 6 hours."	3	7	3	3	0

I have purchased Dell products for many years because I require their ease of use and dependability. However, this model is the exception. It was slow from the beginning but on day 35 of the 30 day return policy it downshifted into low gear and now barely works at all. Will not respond to links and basic commands. Lesson learned: my next laptop will be an iPad!	3	0	0	7	4

Best laptop for looks and performance. The fan is only noticeable when I put my ear up to it, even while living in Phoenix! It feels amazing to carry, especially for a student.The battery life is the best I've seen. WAY better than my Surface Pro 3. By the time I open the lid all the way, Windows Hello has already recognized me and logged me in with no wait time at all. The laptop is lightweight, and performs snappier than my Surface Pro 3 i7. The screen looks amazing, and the touch is incredible especially for how slim the screen is. The keyboard is surrounded by amazing fabric that is light on your wrists while typing (no it doesn't stink and hasn't changed colors) and the keys with 1.5 mm travel feel like a premium keyboard. I have loved this laptop for the week of using it for my junior year in college. Great purchase and well done Microsoft.	2	7	2	3	3
"This laptop replaced an older 11"" Asus VivoBook, which had served us well for years but was getting doggy. This laptop Is a great travel/around-the-house/light office work model. Form factor is fantastic, THIN, like WAFER THIN, and very light. Great case design and quality construction. Snappy as all get out: more than sufficient processing power from the i5 8250U chip, sufficient memory to support everyday activity, and SSD for quick boot and file access. No qualms about performance whatsoever. Keyboard and trackpad are good quality with snappy reaction. Screen is pretty good, although there is a little light bleed evident at the bottom and top bezels on boot-up. Not noticeable during operation, though. Integrated graphics are fine for typical Windows operations and video rendering, but not recommend this laptop for any sort of demanding applications or gaming."	2	5	2	3	4
The HD is verrrrry small. Don't use it for a lot of storage, but the size is what I was after. Smaller than the Apple Air, but a little heavier and a mere fraction of the cost.	2	0	0	1	5
Let me start off by saying that I did a lot of research into this model before deciding to buy, so I have no idea why other reviews are complaining about features not included. I strongly considered the Dell XPS 13 and similar ultrabooks in this price/feature range. I decided to go with the gram for a number of reasons, which include the ability to add RAM and storage.I have had it for a few days and I am extremely impressed with what LG has done with the latest version of the gram. After seeing previous models and having one or two things that really turned me off (the camera located by the hinge), I am thrilled to see that LG listened to customer feedback and made changes.The 8th generation i5 has proven quite fast and I have not had any issues with any of what I have thrown at it. Battery life is excellent, but I have not put the 22 hours to the test yet. I am currently on battery saver and at 75% remaining it says I have 17 hours and 25 minutes left. The fan isn‚Äôt silent on load but it isn‚Äôt crazy loud either ‚Äì I would classify it as normal. I do like that the fan vent openings face to the rear of the computer (see video) instead of facing down. This allows it to stay cooler when it is being used on your lap, the air can escape.The fit and form of the laptop is top notch. It does not feel flimsy or cheap and does not flex or bend. I do not think that there will be any issues, it feels sturdy and well-made. The screen is sharp, clear, and plenty bright. I really like the keyboard and the touchpad. I think LG did a great job with the keys, they have just the right amount of travel. I would call the touchpad good, I have not had any issues with it so far. I also like the Fn buttons, particularly the keyboard backlight, touchpad on/off, and reader mode (reduces blue light).Unfortunately, the Windows 10 it came with had all kinds of bloatware. I attached the screenshot of the used space on the hard drive when I received it (35.6 GB) and when I formatted and put a fresh install of Windows 10 Home back on and added the LG drivers/software from the website (16.8 GB). The difference is crazy, I would recommend that everyone wipe their systems, reinstall Windows, and download the LG software. It saves a ton of space and give you a lot more control of what is on your system. This isn‚Äôt just advice for this particular laptop, but really any computer you buy these days.I did not want a fingerprint reader, I did not want an i7, I did not want a touchscreen. I wanted a fast, 8th generation, extremely portable computer for grad school and everything that comes with that (video chat, internet use, writing, etc.). I also wanted the longest possible battery life ‚Äì which is why this model is perfect for me. So far it has delivered and I am extremely pleased with the new gram.I will update this review if anything changes.Pros:It is extremely lightUpgradeableIt is a great looking computerThe keyboard and touchpad are fantasticCons:No Fn key on the right side of the keyboard (personal preference)No Thunderbolt 3Bloatware (which all companies do these days)	2	5	2	3	3

A 32 GB hard drive is completely consumed by the operating system. Yes, it has Windows 10 and that's all you'll ever have. Also, it cannot apply updates to Windows 10 because there is not enough hard drive space. Get used to an error message about that every time you turn the machine on.Also it claims to come with a year of Office products, but when you receive it there is an insert in the package that says this is no longer true. They are installed, but there is no license.I like it for being lightweight and cute, but can't recommend and wouldn't buy again.	0	9	0	1	4
"I wanted a machine for email, internet, and various office functions. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. IT is slow when you're use to tablets and high speed computers with ""instant on"". After it's on, it works very good. It is also lite and easy to carry with a good battery life and screen."	0	9	0	2	4
Cannot recommend. This laptop did not even last seven months. Unable to get it started. It was purchased on March 3rd of this year. Please look for something else so that you too don't get stiffed 7 or 9 or even 9 months down the road.	2	0	0	1	5
After a few months the charging cable wasn't being recognized properly by the laptop. It is no longer charging the laptop, so the only way to use it is to keep it plugged in. If I wanted a desktop, I would have bought a desktop.	3	7	3	3	0
This computer is a beast.If anyone needs a computer that can run overwatch at high settings with almost 80 fps, this is for you. I'm sure turning stuff down will make the frames higher. After coming from a computer that ran on the lowest settings at 20 fps, this is amazing.The fan is an amazing detail on it. It'll cool the computer down immediately. So t hats a huge plus. Also the matte screen is a blessing too. From a person who wears glasses it's perfect. You don't get the extra glare from the screen.	3	7	2	8	0
First one I received fully crashed within 4 months, Microsoft has the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Amazon was great to deal with and sent a replacement, love the computer when its working, hopefully the second one lasts longer than 4 months	2	7	2	3	3
Could not get over the weird concave bend in the metal chassis the Keyboard sits in. LG told me this is normal but it looks like a defect in the assembly. I cannot tell for sure if it is defect or design, but I don't want to risk it.Not sure why the flat metal area around the keyboard and below the screen would need to be bent downward in such a way.(To describe it one way, it looked a little like what you would expect your laptop Keyboard to look like if someone sat on it.)The metal top should be flat front to back and not curved at the back of or behind the keyboard.Otherwise Very Nice Packaging & Nice looking Machine. If it wasn't for the weird curved area around the top for the keyboard it would have been a keeper.	3	5	2	3	3
I purchased this as a replacement laptop for my wife, who games a lot. This was delivered to me with what I believe to be a faulty hard drive. I know everything there is to know about computer hardware, so read on to find out how I attempted to solve the problem.From the get-go, we found boot times to be abysmally slow and performance once inside Windows was just as bad. Sluggish programs that took ages to open, slow installs and transfers and 100% disk usage reported by task manager on a near constant basis. That seemed to me like a sign of an either bad hard drive or Windows 10 being Windows 10. I tried various tweaks to Windows to improve disk performance, but nothing seemed to work. I then ran chkdsk, which found no issues with the (generic WD) drive (you don't want to know how long that chkdsk run took). So I decided to resort to buying a new high-performance hard drive replacement to avoid sending the laptop back and waiting for weeks for a refund or replacement. The laptop performed admirably in games after all, which at least signified that the CPU and GPU have no issues.In the end, a new hard drive seems to have been what was needed. No more taking ages to boot, transfer files and 100% disk usage. Having to spend extra money and stress over having to fix a brand new laptop has me obviously pissed off, though.Another thing I should mention. You CAN run Windows 7 on this laptop, if you change the boot mode to Legacy, but you will not be able to game on it, which is a shame because Windows 10 is an abomination. Intel has not released Windows 7 graphics drivers for this CPU gen (on purpose, to push Windows 10). You can technically find a way around this restriction and install the drivers by modifying the Windows 10 drivers themselves, but they will still be non-functional in this particular model because it has switchable graphics. Thank Intel and Microsoft for this.	3	7	3	8	0
Insanely Slow, i was doing work on my phone faster then this. Returned it right away. Constant crashing while installing programs, and they took forever to install. Just spend a lil more for a better laptop and save your self the trouble	3	7	3	8	6
I hate this damn computer. The app store is very limited. If you are a andriod user this is not for you (smartphone). YouTube, Amazon, google drive, google maps, and most other popular apps are not available to you. If Msft would create more apps then it would be ok. Now I am looking to get rid of it. It is worthless.	2	7	2	3	3
Bought this for my dad for his birthday! Hes very old school. Kept trying to poke the screen thinking it was a touch screen, but its not. Haha. He uses it a lot and its way better than the little one he had. Also a lot faster! If you are a more advanced computer/laptop person, this one may not be best. My dad just turned 51 and this is just right for him! Nothing too fancy.	2	0	0	1	2
Good laptop, all works fine. The only issue is Dell's approach. Small notebook 2 in 1 shouldn't be so heavy in 2018. Many minor things doing it less competitive to Asus and Mac than it could be. Weight, look, buttons...	2	6	3	3	3
The computer, the speed is great. But I despise windows 10. Also, I have returned it because it advertises a CD/DVD writer, but it not only does not have a writer, but does not come with a DVD or CD player. I have a ton of software that I have to load onto it, that comes with CDs/DVDs so after spending days setting it up with my preferences, I begin to install software only to learn that I don't have a DVD/CD rom. Also, Windows 10 forces you to create an account to log in with. It is annoying.	3	7	3	8	4
This is the best laptop you can get for its price. Amazing quality and best small laptop. my only problem is that the colors aren't so vibrant BUT this has no other faults at all. Completely worth your money.	2	0	0	1	5
So, I've been using this laptop for like a month and one night I see that the screen is black, after waiting for a while I just push the off button and when I turned it on I got a Windows error.I restored the laptop and this green lines appeared, but not only that, windows started to work very slow and with a lot of problems.	3	7	3	8	0
DOWNLOAD LINUX. Here's the deal, bought this for gf at xmas for school..at first it worked ok.. THEN the updates were released, the hardware/storage couldn't handle Etc.. it was rendered worthess..sad gf.. I installed Ubuntu linux for 100% free and ERASED windows. Runs GREAT!!! I have used it with multiple linux distros, all worked awesome. My preference is PARROT LINUX HOME. Beginners will like Mint or Ubuntu..btw Microsoft office equivalent comes free on linux.. Libre OfficeI never write reviews but took the time because I genuinely feel bad for the owners who dont know. Really, the laptop runs ubuntu linux excellent for most every day users, for the price, you will agree. Otherwise, its headed to the garbage... just back up your stuff and switch..dont be afraid to make the switch, linux is very easy to use and FAR better than mac or windows. Plus, you can run WINE for free, it enables windows apps on linux.. no brainer.Just type the words MINT LINUX into GoogleYou will be so happy! Greatly improved speed, picture clarity, wifi and battery is soooo much better.With windows 0 stars. With linux 5 stars!!PARENTS, check out linux for kids. FREEWant quicken and other book keeping apps for FREE? Check out GNU CASH, works awesome.Nerdy? Grab an RTL-SDR for $15 and listen to shortwave radio, satellite weather images, radio astronomyWe enjoy using the hdmi port to each hd movies on our TV.Laptop is seriously powerful now.Note to parents, gamers may be still be disappointed.. $100 laptop just isn't gonna make the cut graphics wise...tell them to read a book instead.	0	9	0	1	4

This thing is so slow, even with no extraneous programs installed on it. I spent several hours trying to clean it up and using other tricks involving disabling various windows features to try to fix it, and it's still slow. As I'm sitting here typing this on my main computer, it's shooting up to 100% disk usage while I'm not running anything except task manager.It looks really cool; the graphics card is pretty nice, but we can't play anything because it has heavy stutter and programs take too long to load.Also, the laptop box wasn't sealed, so that has me concerned that someone had already returned this before.I wanted to like this, but I am profoundly disappointed by it.	3	6	5	8	0
"NEW REVIEW:I got one of these and it blew out on me in about 3 weeks. No idea why. Despite the comment below, I had it on a laptop cooler and I wasn't doing anything that would generate heat when it blew out. Research revealed that this was not a common problem with these machines, so I'm guessing I got one that just had something go wrong with it (not the first time that's ever happened to me).I sent it back to Amazon, got a refund and then bought another one. So far so good. I liked the laptop enough to warrant purchasing another one, so I thought it only fair that I revise my rating. Providing this one doesn't blow out on me in a couple of weeks, I see no reason not to rate it 5-stars (original rating had been 3-stars).It's an amazing little machine that runs everything I throw at it.OLD REVIEW:A great laptop, but it stopped working completely after about three and a half weeks of use. It shut down while I was doing light work (nothing that would generate any major heat) and then never came on again. Had it kept working, I would have probably thought it was the best laptop I ever owned, but given that it gave out on me after such a short time, I'm not sure I can recommend it. I'm giving it three stars because when it did work, it worked great. I was able to play ""The Witcher 3"" on ultra video settings with a very good frame rate (even though I usually knocked it down to high).There's no guarantee that my experience will be the same as yours though. No idea why mine stopped working. Good luck with your purchase. I had to return mine."	3	7	3	8	0
I bought a refurbished unit and it works perfectly. I use it mainly to connect to the internet and work in the cloud. It has been problem free. The price was outstanding.	3	1	0	0	2
This laptop would be great if the monitor wasn't so terrible. I had backlight bleed watching movies no matter how I set the brightness or contrast. Two of these were defective. I sure hope they don't consider this bleeding acceptable. My 6 year old Asus it replaced has darker black and no spill and it was only about 400 dollars. Too bad. This thing loads fast, is light weight, has plenty of power for work and play, but it's just terrible for doing any work with night charts, movies or anything other than surfing web pages. One computer had problems bleeding from the top left corner, bottom right and center. This one has some bleeding from the bottom left and just right of center. It is distracting and annoying. Completely unacceptable in this day and age. Frustrating as all heck. Thankfully, Amazon customer service processed my rant and is taking good care of me.Honestly, I would not purchase an asus product again after this experience. Quality control is extremely important in technology.	2	5	2	3	4
After looking at pricey laptops with the same or similar specs, I bought this one. It is for my daughter, great video, super fast she loves it, and $900 less than apple.	3	9	2	8	6
No backlit keyboard makes this system really REALLY difficult to use at night.So far smooth start up and use which beats my old asus that just died but I'm really disappointed by the keyboard which should be baseline feature on ANY laptop by this point... Seriously.Really, I'd trade the start up speed for the ability to see what the heck I'm writing at night.	3	6	2	9	3
"I got this computer right after my old Lenovo crashed right before my final exams. I'm a college student and was looking for something functional, inexpensive, and durable. This is cheap, but neither durable nor functional for the most part. I've had it for about 4 months and I'm already looking for a replacement. It's incredibly slow for even the most basic things and it has next to no storage space for any apps, documents, programs, photos, etc. I have problems with ""blue screens"" now - it randomly shuts down and must restart because of an unspecified ""problem with my PC."" The speakers don't always work and the wireless driver (what allows me to connect to wifi) isn't always recognized so I don't have consistent internet. All in all, a very poorly designed product that is fairly useless."	2	0	0	1	5
Amazing customer service, great laptop with amazing specs for it's price. the reviews were wrong about the TN panel and it's actually IPS. the quality is great and i can run games with 60+ fps at max settings. i got 150 fps on league of legends and i couldnt tell the exact fps on overwatch, but it was VERY smooth and it should be more than enough for gaming. the only issue i have is the noise of the cooling fan, but it was expected and it isnt noticable when you wear headphones.	3	7	2	8	0
"I guess the ""phantom touch"" thing wasnt just me. The first one i bought would spaz out when i folded it in half just about every time, so a week later i sent it to have it replaced. The second one seemed to work nice, for a while till the ""phantom touches"" came back but this time my laptop wasn't folded in half like the first laptop..This is very bad considering I had finals and lots of essay I couldn't write or had to wait for these spazes to stop. Really annoying. Wont be buying again."	1	1	0	1	4
I purchased this laptop last night from best buy, It was on sale for 309$ At this price point you can get a laptop that is touch screen but lacks good battery life or performance, You can get a laptop with bad performance and decent battery life or you can get this. Considering the price point this laptop is quit powerful. Overall the speakers don't sound terrible but they are down firing and don't get super loud, the display isn't the brightest but it is definitely not dim by any means. The colors on the display are not the best but certainly okay for the price point. when folded open the screen doesn't wobble around and overall the build quality is nice. AGAIN considering the price point. The keyboard definitely isn't the worst I've used. Overall I would recommend this laptop if you're a college student like me or if you are wanting a bigger laptop and on a budget. Overall the laptop doesn't get crazy loud under load. IF BATTERY LIFE IS A MAJOR CONCERN this might be an issue for you. While listening to music with the volume around 75% surfing the web this laptop only lasted around 3.5 hrs, battery saver is turned on about 85%. Battery life isn't a major concern for me because im usually around an outlet. overall this laptop is worth the price considering the pros and cons. the biggest con is the battery life.	3	2	1	8	7
We have several tablets in our family, but this is actually the first laptop we have used in a few years. The Microsoft Surface Laptop combines some of the best features of a tablet, such as touch screen capability, thin and lightweight portability, and features like facial recognition software, with some of the dedicated laptop features that I have been wanting for a while, such as a permanent keyboard and touch pad. At less than three pounds, this really is a remarkable unit that boasts the power of a PC with the footprint of an iPad Pro.There are a few features here that I especially appreciate, such as the surprisingly soft textured keyboard cover that I was not at all expecting. Not only does the speckled gray color blend nicely with the laptop exterior, but it's easy on my wrist and fingers when typing or scrolling along the touch pad. Beyond the keyboard, which is much sturdier than the portable Bluetooth keyboards that I have used with my iPad over the years (that consistently fall apart after a few months), this responsive touchscreen works just as well as my iPad Air 2. It's very easy to shift from keyboard to touch pad to touchscreen depending upon what I am working on or trying to accomplish.Although I have not used many laptops in recent years, I found this unit to be very reliable and on point based on my knowledge of what is available in the market. The 8GG RAM makes this unit quite fast and responsive--in fact one of the best I have encountered on a PC. As with most modern laptops, the hard drive is solid state which allows for greater ease and reliability when travelling. The drive has 256GB which holds plenty of video, music, and document files. I use this to supplement my larger desktop computer at home, but it is perfectly functional and has the capacity to serve as someone's primary or only PC on a regular day-to-day basis.I am in a unique position in terms of brand loyalty because I have almost excessively been a Microsoft user in terms of computers while at the time only really using Apple mobile devices. There is definitely a convergence of styles here with this laptop. In fact, just looking at the white box with its minimalist, streamlined design, I could have sworn I was opening an iPad Pro or something similar from Apple. Even the charger is somewhat reminiscent of an Apple unit (although in black). If you are traditionally a MacBook user, I think you will find plenty to like with this Surface Laptop. All in all, I was very impressed and will make good use of this at home, in the office, and on the go.	2	7	2	3	3
After a few days after purchase, I must say that this is a fantastic purchase for the price. Granted, I do not keep up with recent laptop technology as it hits the market, but compared to the Asus laptop that i have upgraded from that was new about 4 years ago, this product is an entirely new generation from my previous experience. I must say that still, after years of development the track pads of these more affordable laptops are still not nearly as good as the front runners, such as apple. Even with this downfall, the performance with the SSD makes the operating system really snappy and the ability to upgrade the RAM adds and included bonus for performance. This is by no means a performance gaming system that will deliver 4k or VR capabilities, but if you are looking for a decent, well priced laptop with incredible potential for general use, artistic and occasional gaming capabilities, this is the product you have been looking for! The keyboard feels nice, backlit keys(in just the red LED) is nice, 2 in 1 maneuverability is surprisingly useful(I like to put it into tent mode with a PS4 controller when I'm gaming), screen looks great, touchscreen is surprisingly responsive, speakers are better than expected, the red accenting looks nice and you just can't complain about what you have paid for. The only thing I would ask for is a more narrow bezel on the screen, but really, what does that matter?	3	6	3	3	0
"Who sells a computer, calls it Windows but when it comes it's Windows 10S, the ""Free"" upgrade to Windows Pro doesn't work, there's no Windows certification sticker anywhere and it demands a Product code you don't supply. Of course in the anti-competetive ways of Microsoft you can't install Chrome, Firefox or Java because they are ""unverfied Apps"". What a bunch of crap this computer might as well be a boat anchor with me stuck with the virus called Microsoft Edge and absolutely no paperwork with a Product code which the last time I checked meant it's not a legal version of Windows. Try to say in your add that new users will have a nightmare of trying to make this a workable computer, what a waste of my time."	2	0	0	1	5
Hard drive storage is small...32 gigs....(small?....lol), but I don't need a lot of space. I bought it to write a book, so it'll be fine. It has a micro sad card slot and I found a 512 gigabyte card.(yes, that's 512 GIGABYTES), but I don't really need that much space, so I'll probably use something smaller, and use that somewhere else	2	0	0	1	5
"I think this Chromebook from Samsung is a great product.Sure, always depends on ""expectations"", is not and hi-end or hi-level pc, but is and absolutely good combination between a tablet and a notebook.Th OS is fast, really fast. Even if this chromebook is equipped with the ARM processor, all seems perfectly optimize and run very well.Is nice you can install apps from the play store, they works great (at least the ones I tested).the battery last for 6-8h depends on usage, but looks pretty decent to me.only downside, the audio quality is not the best. Sound is clear but is a bit ""low"" and not really ""rich"" in bass.I think for the price is a very good deal."	1	1	0	1	4
After reading so many reviews about this laptop, I was a bit sceptical about buying it, but I eventually did and I am glad I did. It is such a beauty and it's pretty fast too. The screen is not crappy like many would have you believe.	3	9	3	8	0
Features that wow:Price vs value equation due to discrete Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processorUpgraded i7 Kaby Lake with less heat, lower power consumptionFast boot with 128 G SSD hard driveGood screen with low light leakageRed backlit full size keyboard with number padUnderstated styling (low bling), but enough to be happyBright TN screenRelatively solid build, soft touch plasticsLow fan noise even under loadRelatively low weight at 5 lbsFeatures that are less impressive:Plastic everywhereSound is averageDell is not known for making its own Dell branded computer gaming powerhouses‚Äîfor that you have to jump up in price and bling to Alienware. With Dell‚Äôs dedicated Alienware brand you get lots of bells and whistles, including molded style metal cases, very solid builds, full lighting controls, generally nice specs and higher prices. Why change near mid cost perfection with the same case and essentially same innards as the prior i7559 build? This current computer is almost the same with the better Kaby Lake chip set and mostly the same Nvidia GTX1050 (vs GTX 960m). Styling wise the Inspiron is not Alienware, but with some nice red accents on the rear facing under screen grill and a red Dell logo on the lid, the Inspiron distinguishes itself as not your father‚Äôs Dell. [Full disclosure, having owned and upgraded from the prior Alienware M11X R3 laptop along with an i7559, I do love Alienware laptops.]First, Kaby Lake intel i7 chipset represents one of the best solutions to lower heat, lower power consumption with higher performance than the prior generation. Same for the Nvidia GTX1050‚Äîwhich performance wise during gaming, produces less heat and uses less power for similar performance (if not slightly higher in actual use!) than the prior equivalent graphics processer GTX960. This means that a gaming laptop can be built without it being a vacuum cleaner or jet engine for heat control at load. The current Kaby Lake i7 chip is highly acceptable and powerful enough to run just about anything you can toss.The 128 G SSD comes loaded with Windows 10 and it is suggested to jump immediately to updates at Microsoft and Dell for the latest drivers. [I moved immediately to W10-Creators and had no issues.] I was hoping that under the rear screw panel there might be room for removal of the 1T disc based 5200 RPM HD for replacement with an SSD, but no such luck. I suppose it could be done but it was not turnkey like a couple of prior iterations of this same laptop case. Startup is quick with the main operating system on the 128G SSD, at less than 30 seconds under normal circumstances. The 1T hard drive operates acceptably with Steam game files and other data in place.So Kaby Lake i7 and Nvidia GTX1050 is a perfect lower cost, lower heat alternative and partner with improvements over prior Skylake ‚Äì GTX960 combo? Yes it is. No, it is not a GTX1060-70-80, each with progressively faster game frame rates, and higher quality settings during gaming, but most will find the 1050 a good alternative to higher prices. Gamers should and would question if the GTX1050 will play the games they want to play‚Äîand the 1050 may have limits depending on the game. For the games I play the most, I can report full functionality with high settings and Physix running on high settings for all the Borderlands series games, Fallout 4, and DOOM on this capable Dell Inspiron. While I cannot report on actual FPS, there is no obvious slowdowns in full action movement for these games. This laptop does like to be plugged in for game play at these levels, which I am used to from prior laptops. If you are not plugged in, you may have some movement and frame rate stutters in more demanding games at higher settings. The Nvidia 1050 provides low heat output at load. This Dell runs quiet with no audible fan noise at normal loads and tasks. When pushed during gaming the fan is audible but is very quiet so you would not necessarily need headphones during game play.The keyboard itself is good with a bit of play and solid feeling but no noticeable flex. Not mechanical but adequate. It is friendly to gaming and touch typing with full size keys and a nice number pad. Red LED lighting can be turned off or dimmed.The 15.6-Inch FHD TN screen has wide viewing angles, is very bright, and good color representation. As an improvement over the prior 7559 version, this sample does not have any border light leakage.Mouse pads are a sore point with many. The use of single surface pads is happening more and more, and often a source of issues. Having a work based ThinkPad, with a mostly unusable integrated pad, I always jump to a dedicated mouse. The Dell Inspiron‚Äôs pad is a bit better with mostly positive and separated sections for ‚Äúright/left‚Äù buttons‚Äîalthough the offset may not appeal to all. Of course, if you are buying this laptop for gaming, you are already going to use a dedicated mouse.Sound quality is acceptable with good stereo separation, although the subwoofer is certainly not earthshaking. Strangely enough, out of the box, some diagnostic work was required and drivers had to be reinstalled due to no sound. Admirably, Windows made this simple with a quick restart.So, should you buy this laptop? Personally, for the games I play and the tasks I do, this is a great laptop for the price, albeit not ‚Äúperfect‚Äù . You should consider what games you may play and read additional reviews regarding the suitability of the Nvidia GTX1050 for your own uses prior to jumping to any system that has similar specs. Great value and recommended.	3	9	3	8	0
Nice heavy laptop. Good color and speed. Not a big fan of Windows 10 but it's ok. Laptop locks up sometimes and I have to set it aside and let it cycle through whatever stalled it. Overall it's a good laptop that's built well and stays cool.	3	0	0	7	5
This computer has had issues since the day I bought it. The technical support is with techs whom I can barely understand. They want me to send it to them and it could take 5-12 business days. I will never buy another Dell computer.	3	4	3	2	3
I got this laptop last Friday and I'm going to return it back tomorrow. This is THE WORST gaming laptop you can have.Almost every one of them has motherboard issues due to BIOS settings that Dell IS NOT WILLING TO SOLVE SINCE LAST YEAR. My laptop started to shut down alone without reason after one hour of use and sometimes it simply doesn't turn it on and I have to let it rest for 2 or 3 hours. I tried to play Overwatch in it and after 30 seconds entering the game it shut down. Every single time I tried the machine turns on sends me to BIOS config and sometimes it decides to not recognize the SSD.Please, don't bother buying this, you're going to regret it and you're going to waste a lot of time. If you don't believe me check Dell's forums. There are hundreds and hundreds of these machines that don't work or have a lot of issues that any new or used-like new machine should have.	3	7	2	8	0
My last laptop was a Dell that ran solidly for over eight years. I have had this one for a bit over a year and it's been problem after problem. I am looking at having to replace the screen entirely shortly-- the touchscreen started malfunctioning and making the computer unusable after about six months until I disabled it. Now the screen has started flickering and if my computer falls asleep, I have to reboot it because it wakes up with a blank white screen. On top of everything, it's run very slow from day one, fresh out of the box. It's got a great price, but keep looking. This is not a quality machine.	3	9	3	9	3
I Love this Chromebook. I love the small keyboard. I love how light it is. I love the size of the screen. I love the resolution. I love that it is a chromebook, and I don't have to go wading through installed programs to figure out what is making everything slow down. Ditto for worrying about a virus or malware. For people who are still working on a laptop, man, I hope you have to work with some heavy duty software, because otherwise you are missing out. My husband has a straight chromebook and it is great, but app compatibility and the memory with the Pro makes this the bridge for actually working with a chromebook. I took an online class and was able to download the plugin for Adobe Connect, no problem. Although the mike was a little laggy. I prefer to work on this so much that I have really explored the wealth of apps out there to make everything work. It's like the undiscovered country working with a full fledged browser and the app store. So when other students are trying to figure out how to edit pdf files-- do they have to buy 365, or Adobe?-- I am already in Dochub. This is an expensive chromebook-- but it still doesn't have the monetary value of a laptop-- but when my kid spilled a cup of tea on it, and I could spend $150 repairing or ditch it, I repaired it immediately. And then I sat on my hands until it came. And then gave thanks to have my favorite electronic back again.	1	1	0	1	4
This is a great computer, be it a laptop or a vivo book. No matter what you call it it works. I love the metal body and the finish on it.

"Sigh..where do I start? This laptop has been an utter disappointment. First, it didn't come with the year-long subscription to office 365. Then I wasn't able to download any apps because of a file error. On top of that it is extremely slow and not at all user friendly. Just today I turned it on and it kept going for more than 20 minutes ""working on updates."" I realize it is very cheap and you get what you pay for but I didn't pay for something to require an essential file error fix in order for it to work. I am not a heavy-duty laptop user. I only do light browsing and basic word processing. I don't need all the bells and whistles so this should have fit the bill but it didn't even come close.For comparison, I bought an Acer chromebook at around the same price point a few years back and even after being used extensively and banged around a bit it is still going strong and it is still fast.I will never buy another ASUS again. This laptop is a disgrace and Amazon should not sell it or should at least offer a refund with no restocking fee."	2	0	0	1	5
One thing you need to understand is that the Android app support is in beta mode. The tablet functionality is still very much in development. That means when you switch over to tablet the experience will not be iPad or Android tablet-like. Some apps may freeze, crash. But others work well. I've used Adobe Acrobat Reader to comment and highlight documents, which I then upload to Adobe's document cloud and view them on my PC. There are no issues. My Kindle app performs well as well. Some of the handwriting apps work beautifully with the pen.The screen is the best laptop screen I've used at any price. The images are clear, crisp and exceptionally bright. The touch screen is very responsive. Battery life is good, the system is lightweight and it seems to travel well.If you are complaining about a lack of backlighting on keyboard, well, that shouldn't have been a surprise.	1	1	0	1	4
Great gaming laptop for the money. I'll start out saying i really only play World of Warcraft and a few simple games on steam, but for that purpose, I've found only minor faults with this machine. Wow runs smoothly even in new areas with dense player load, but this is on a custom setting i use that's below ultra but above middle of the road. Pros: great performance for the money, looks good, solid build quality, decent battery. Cons: sound quality through stock speakers is lackluster, keyboard lighting features are basically nonexistent, 1050ti already technically outdated, but solid for the price point, cooling fan is a bit loud. I realize it may sound like im beating up on a computer i gave 5 stars, but I could not find something better for the price.	3	6	3	3	0
"This has been a fine laptop, for 6 months. At this point, the hinge for the screen disconnected from the base of the laptop as shown in the images. The hinge then pushed the keyboard up and away, breaking plastic clips in the process. I am understanding of occasional hardware failures, but Dell is claiming that the failure is not covered under warranty, as it is ""Accidental Damage"". This is a $239 repair for an almost new laptop."	3	7	3	3	0
for the prize it's a great deal, works great for me and easy to upgrade when you get the money. I when from a ASUS gl551 15 inch which I love to this Laptop both ASUS and love them they both work great as long as you take care and I do	4	7	3	8	0
Extremely happy. It is light weight, very fast and has a long life battery. Well worth every penny and I was thinking about getting another because it is so portable. It does not have a dvd/cd player but for the price you can buy an external one.	3	1	0	0	2
It's slow and one of the keys popped off when I was typing, complicating to put back on so I sent the product back. Pretty disappointed, I needed this for school, a big set back. Sucks I didn't get a good experience like most of the people that bought this product.	2	0	0	1	5
My 88 yr old mother had always been frustrated with whatever laptop she had at the time. I bought her this to make things simpler for her AND because she was convinced that she would be able to see a white keyboard better than black. She loves this chromebook.	2	1	0	0	4
With each passing year, I'm becoming more and more of an ASUS fan. I love the quality, utilitarian build of their products. Everything is no nonsense and I appreciate that at a time when companies are over indexing on unnecessary and unwanted features.// PROSBATTERY LIFE: The low voltage Kaby Lake processor in this laptop means that the battery lasts and lasts. In addition, the battery itself is replaceable, meaning you can carry an extra one. Perfect for travel when charging could happen infrequently.BUILD QUALITY:This laptop looks and feels solid. It's exactly what you want for the rigors of commuting and travel. It would also make a great machine for the kids.TRACK PAD AND KEYBOARD: The track pad on the P2540UA has the perfect responsiveness and includes useful gestures. ASUS has nailed this. Other laptop manufacturers' track pads can be overly responsive to the point where they're difficult to control and cause unwanted clicks and scrolls. The ASUS also includes a full keyboard with keys that have a satisfying travel. This is another area where manufacturers' skimp on lower-end machines, but ASUS has don't a nice job here.EXPANDABLE MEMORY: ASUS has made it almost trivial to add RAM to this laptop. While 8GBs is a great start for a simple productivity machine, the ability to easily upgrade is always welcome. I immediately added¬†Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400 MT/S (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory (CT8G4SFS824A)¬†to double the RAM and it took all of 5 minutes.64-BIT WINDOWS 10: This machine comes with 64-bit Windows 10 and allows you to take advantage of everything the OS and Cortana have to offer.NO BLOATWARE: What a treat! This system isn't littered with bloatware.PRICE: This ASUS is phenomenally priced for what you get.// CONSDISPLAY: The display is proving to be lackluster. The viewing angle is poor. You have to manipulate the screen to just the right angle or you lose contrast...significantly. I've found the range of acceptable viewing to have only about 10-15-degrees of freedom. Once you find the sweet spot, it performs ok, but it's poor for any graphics related tasks (or photo manipulation) as the color, contrast, and clarity are not at all there.GRAPHICS: The on-board graphics for this machine uses Intel HD 620, meaning there is no dedicated graphics VRAM. However, you can expand your RAM (see above) and allocate more memory here. An Internet search will tell you how.//SUMMARYOverall, I think this is a great system for business productivity and travel or as a durable machine for the kids. (Heck, it might be ideal that the sound isn't optimal in the latter case. ;) )	3	9	2	8	3
This laptop just pissed me off so badly I bought it like one week ago and now the laptop just never work ever again. And the noise of this laptop is really bad. HATED (worst gift for my brother ever )	3	7	2	8	0
This is an incredible product. I owned a mac for 6 years before this and it has totally superseded the mac. I was looking for an affordable touch screen labtop that was bigger than mac's 12 inch screen. The screen is clear and vivid, the touch screen works incredibly well. The bundle deal was such an attractive offer to get one price and have it all included. It even came with a kate spade case and a mouse that is so easy to bring around when you flatten it. I got a student discount as well. It's light, durable, and the best purchase I've ever made. better than apple, so happy with it! BUY IT!	2	8	2	3	3
It froze up on me from the very beginning!?? Idk if I just received a lemon or what but I had to return it and am looking for the perfect touchscreen laptop on the market and am willing to pay in the ballpark of $400-less than $600 if possible! Needed for home use and the best program for pictures?? Can anyone help me find what I‚Äôm looking for???	3	1	0	8	2
Adding photos later, but here is my initial review.Unboxing, super easy and secure.Gaming runs smooth for low res since I mainly game on ps4, but for designing, these are the concerns.AutoCAD - efficient and no issues except large 3D architecture structures give some lag when rendering. Easy fix with larger SSD and 8gb more ram most likely for these issues.AutoDesk Maya - Rigs are smooth to place in Morrison Builder without lag, but the special effects of rain, snow, ice and such that I've coded and composed still gives lag. It doesn't freeze entirely like my old PC did. Turbo ran it efficiently for the testing that I needed at least.Photoshop - lags with brush sizes larger than 50pt. The display is purely impressive for me to customize 8K pictures. Very nice colour, tone and depth in the visual display. Also antiglare.Sony Soundforge - Does not have bass. Needs a sub or use bluetooth( not told in details about) to sync up a sub speaker or the aux port( mic port available too).Sony Vegas Pro - Converting Camtasia files and editing takes not too long for 1080p. A 4 hour stream I clipped to 12 minutes only took maybe 35 minutes to go to the highlights and editing and a 4-ten minute to finalize and convert.OBS - So, some of these may be because of the bandwidth for streaming. Currently the stream played flawless for my Intro, AFK Screen and Outro. During the stream, there was some latency issues with mic and video not syncing, but no issues with the black screen or pixelation.Gamers.Runescape and League of Legends run flawless on max settings.Perfect World, Forsaken world, Shaiya, Rusty Hearts, NeverWinter are at 60fps+ at 73% of settings maxed.Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, EVE and Dead by Daylight Run 60fps+ at 45-53% Of settings maxed.Fortnite, Darwin Project, PubG, Paladins Battlegrounds, H1Z1 and Ark all ran at max settings at 30fps+ without dropping. If moving to 60fps, I'd recommend upgrading ram and install on SSD instead of HDD, Wired (LAN), increasing RAM. At that point it should run close to 60fps flawless. I would recommend running these at minimum except distance for best results of competitive play.Now for the Housing.Compact, medium weight, finger print prone, dust magnet-not, easy to clean, upgrade, downgrade, and integrated with the following.Rj45 port,3.5mm jacks(2), 1 HDMI port, 1 port that I think is a female type C?, USB 3.0(2) USB 2.0(1). With MSI motherboards you can overclock the CPU, GPU, HDD Data transfers and USB ports.	3	7	2	8	0
"I really liked the look of this small laptop, it's a very pretty light gold color, but not a flashy gold. It is a great laptop for the simpler tasks like email, browsing the web, word processing, and playing movies/ videos. Be aware that the 32gb storage will hardly get you anywhere. After the most recent Windows update that installed after I turned the laptop on, there was about 9gb left (after also installing a some basic programs like Avira, Scrivener, Chrome, Flux, and a few others that are not too large). There is a micro SD card you can insert that you can set to default storage so all programs will install on it and the one I tried was a 200gb micro and it worked fine.The computer is pretty fast but some heavy websites will load slower despite a really fast internet connection. I had several tabs open on Chrome as well as a few basic programs and I didn't find it lagging though, which is good.The screen is one of the biggest problems for me as it is so small, the defaulted resolution and text sizes make the print very tiny so if you like a larger font you will have to increase the zoom, text size, and/or resolution. This makes some programs unable to have their windows show up fully on the screen, which can be a real problem if you don't remember where the OK and Cancel buttons were since you cannot see them if you're in a popup window. In particular, Scrivener has this issue where opening up a window like Tools will not show the bottom of the popup window when you have the zoom increased. The other thing that makes this screen a little difficult is the glossy glare which can make it hard on the eyes and very hard to see outside because it also has very limited tilt on the screen so your viewing angles are not the best at times. I do find that the screen is very bright and crisp and slightly better than ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14"", which is the larger, slightly better version of this laptop.The keyboard is my favorite part of this laptop since it is a full keyboard but it has smaller keys and they are closer together. It is fantastic for those that have smaller hands and shorter fingers like me. The keys are chiclet so they click almost like a mechanical keyboard and those are my favorite. It is very easy and smooth to type on.The laptop I received has a good trackpad that glides nicely and has very responsive click buttons. The only thing I had issues with are the multi-touch gestures where you can use two or three fingers to scroll vertically and horizontally. Scrolling vertically with two fingers seemed to make the mouse move all over, despite how careful I was with making sure my two fingers were together and making contact at the same time. The scroll worked most of the time but when it didn't you sometimes accidentally clicked and moved things you didn't mean to.Overall I would give this pc a 8 out of 10. You cannot beat the small weight of a little over 2lbs for this price point and hardware, that is one of the big pluses if you want the ultimate portability. It's perfect for those that don't mind the trackpad issues or smaller screen/font size issues, but for my purpose, which was for writing short stories, I think the issue with having to make the font so much larger to see it comfortably will be a deal breaker since I use Scrivener primarily.If you want something a little larger with a little more power, I would recommend the larger version of this laptop, the ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14"", which is only 1lb heavier.¬†ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14"" Full HD Laptop (Quad-Core N3700, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 128GB eMMC, Windows 10), Metallic Gray"	2	0	0	1	5
It's a really pretty laptop. The keys feel absolutely wonderful. Currently though I am having a 100% disk usage issue (and I just got the laptop) so that slows it down a bit. Also, it feels really sluggish if you're trying to do things too quickly partly because of the lack of an SSD. I feel like once I open it up and stick a ram stick and SSD in it everything should be fine and dandy.Other blemishes: The trackpad has no protruding buttons so if you're not used to that it might be a little difficult to use. It's kind of loud when you click, and it doesn't feel like it's great quality.My perspective: This is the only laptop I've ever touched that has costed more than $300 ~ however those in that range still has a nice trackpad.	3	6	3	8	0
Know what you're getting. The SSD makes up a lot for the slower CPU .. You'll want a 128gb micro SD to use for backups.. perhaps even install a few programs on the microSD .. when you receive this laptop you'll have about 10-12gb of usable space.I bought this as my experiment with windows 10; I'm amazed at how well windows 10 handles the lower specs of this machine. I constantly have chrome open with 5-8 tabs (intensive tabs).. One thing you'll have to get past is the first few windows updates which can seem amazingly slow. You have to realize that these first updates are huge - therefore read up on windows disk cleanup (deleting prior version of windows 10) then create back up images using windows 7 backup included with windows 10Pros are the speed of the SSD, windows 10's ability to handle the lower specsTHE BATTERY LIFE IS STUPID awesome. To me it's the redeeming factor of this laptop.Chrome book price with windows 10 and compatible with full windows apps (not just web apps).. overall a great laptop for anything but gaming.	2	0	0	1	5
Runs cool and quiet. Beautiful ips screen with outstanding viewing angles. Gtx 1070 gsync @ 1080p runs all my games locked at 75hrz with max settings including Witcher 3. All this at a price less than the competition with similar specs. Very happy with my purchase. I can only imagine that people having heat issues are blocking the vents when the unit is on their lap. I keep my Predator on a cooling pad all the time so it is getting proper air flow even when on my lap	4	7	5	8	0
first off it says this has a total of 32G, the one I received only has 29.1G and 29.0G is the operating system...WTF..second I looked everywhere for the mircosoft office 365. its not on here. I cant update because there isn't enough memory. When I tried to use the store app, it says operating system is not configured to run it. I mean what the hell am I suppose to do here. I want my money back not worth it, way to many problems already, its only been 4 days and I'm sick and tired of looking at it. Other than that the computer is gorgeous, mine is just in s***ty condition I guess.	2	0	0	1	5

Although I do 90% of my technology on my phone, I do have a few things that require a PC to do. Some things are just easier to type or do on a laptop than mobile device. I had previously got a Chromebook, but there are many programs and functions that I need that were not compatible. The main hurdle I have faced lately is using my husband's laptop to use my Cricut for new downloads and projects because my Chromebook would not run it. This worked great for SVG and font files and synced flawlessly with my Cricut. From the moment I opened the box, I was pleased to find a shiny new laptop. It was actually a little bigger than I was expecting at the price point, but I was glad to see the keyboard boasted a number pad which is lacking on many laptops. Once I opened it, plugged it in and turned it on, I was greeted by a Cortana, Microsoft's version of Siri. She walked me through the set up process and I was online within minutes. The TB hard drive is a nice asset for a computer in this price point. The screen was okay but not fabulous. If you are looking for a high powered gaming computer, you may be disappointed, but I found it very appropriate for all tasks that I need it for. I would definitely recommend it for as a solid find at this price point.	3	3	1	8	3
Really enjoy this laptop‚Äôs blend of features: it‚Äôs beautifully designed without being fragile, the touchscreen is a useful option, and it‚Äôs quite thin and lightweight. Immediately used the free upgrade to Windows pro 10. No complaints!	2	8	2	3	3
I've had computer only 2 1/2 months, had added new Office day 1, costing as much or more than computer and Computer has died! Wil not open.

Very pleased with this purchase, I got it mostly for my wife to work on her spreadsheets and scheduling for work remotely that being said it runs silently while doing that and the battery life is pretty good.I myself am a gamer and wanted something to be able to play games when away from my desktop we brought it on a trip and I was surprisingly able to play far cry 5 on ultra settings at 1080p while keeping a stable frame rate of 40 to 55 FPS which for a laptop with an i5 and a 1060 max q was awesome though the only downside is. that you have to keep it plugged in and the fans can be a bit noisy but I play with headphones so it wasn‚Äôt a bother at all I would recommend this laptop to anyone at this price point.	3	7	2	8	0
I purchased this product on March 24, 2018, all is working well so far. Except that after I purchased this product, Amazon decided to reduce the price point from $1,096 to $999... That's why I give it a 3 star ratings... Other than that, this device is functioning perfectly well as of my first day of using it, today.	2	5	2	3	3
This is a great laptop - well worth the price but:- As soon as you receive the laptop pull the damn HDD out and put a SSD into it. Makes an ENORMOUS difference in terms of speed and overall responsiveness of the laptop.- Mine had a motherboard issue - it would randomly glitch and turn off. I sent it into Asus repair and had a good experience with them. They fixed it quickly, quietly and sent it back to me.	3	9	2	8	3
Very disappointed with this device. I loved it at first but appears the hinge that connects the top to the keyboard is very cheap and easily torn. It also freezes completely on occasion and not sure what causes this problem. I am sending it in to be repaired and may request a refund.	2	5	2	3	4
Honestly this laptop does me wonders. I play all of my games very smoothly and I only got this laptop for $900. The keyboard feels great, the backlit keyboard is awesome. Fast start up with windows being on the SSD while I could install my games on the hybrid disc. Honestly, if you're looking to buy a laptop well under $1000, this is a pretty good choice. If you want to upgrade to 16GB of RAM, you could do it easy.	3	7	2	8	0
Absolutely love this machine. It is very well engineered, looks top of the line and the chromeOS+Android integration is surprisingly good compared to what I was expecting after reading mixed reviews. The tablet mode works very well, the pen mode is excellent and the keyboard is responsive. Battery life is quite good and I really like the USBC charging so I can use the same charger for my phone and laptop. The only annoyance is the backspace key which is unusually placed.	1	1	0	1	4
"When you purchase this laptop, allow yourself a full day to set it up. First you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery, then Windows updates will take a couple of hours. Then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with (I'm not a gamer, so lots of games had to go). If you are a Windows 10 pro, then you should be good to go. The last Windows computer I had was XP, so Win 10 took a while to get used to. I won't trade my Mac for anything, but I was at the point where I needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients, and since they are all PC users it only made sense to go with a Windows machine.The computer isn't really gold at all, but more of a silvery color. I was worried that it would be flashy and ""in your face"" gold, but it is very subtle.The caps lock button doesn't let you know it is on, and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it. There is also no separate numerical keypad, but maybe that is normal for laptops. I am more of a desktop user.Fingerprint technology is great, although about half the time it doesn't recognize me the first time and I have to do it again. Still, much faster than typing a password. Startup is super fast, literally only a few seconds. I was initially only looking for a $400 or so laptop since this won't get much use, but I am glad I splurged and got something with a much better processor and a SSD for the operating system.This laptop weighs next to nothing, and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock. Really, it's very impressive. I am still on my first battery charge, and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it, but it is warning me now that it is low.The only downside so far is no DVD drive. But I picked up an external Asus Zen Drive (SDRW-08U7M-U) for $29 and it works great. I don't need it often, but my iMac doesn't have a drive either, so now I am all set for both computers since it is plug and play.Overall, I'm very impressed and glad that I chose this model out of the 40+ I looked at on amazon before deciding. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough RAM, and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in. But so far it is very adequate. If, after trying to run Photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging, then I will update my review."	2	7	3	8	3
What an amazing laptop! I comes with no irritating excess software offers like most all the others. I was able to load QuickBooks and my payroll software on it easily and it just works the way it's supposed to! I absolutely love it. What a great laptop for the money. I have an Asus desktop, so I had high expectations for this laptop and it hasn't disappointed.	3	9	2	8	3
On the first day of use, this laptop freezes constantly and won't even tab out.I've had same Dell Inspiron which I used for little more than a year that has the same problem and that is why I bought this one.I guess it's just intrinsic problem with all Dell laptops.	3	7	3	8	0
Annoying traits with this computer. Rarely logs on to internet without being prompted, sometimes takes several tries. Touchpad left clicks often do not work, take a lot of pressure, hard to find a good place to press to engage a non null click. Backlight on keyboard will often require several clicks of the f key to start working. Would have preferred a standard hdmi port. Tiny one on this computer is hard to use and seems like it is designed to wear out. Is slim, but is not light. I guess I expected it to be a little more friendly. It is fast, has good connectivity and I like the non glare screen and chiclet keys. If the touchpad worked better I would have given it 4 stars	2	6	5	4	3

So far i'm impressed with this laptop. I have not run a game on it yet but all web pages only take about 4 seconds to load tops. The fan for this is also dead quiet. one thing that is disappointing, my wireless mouse does not work on the very smooth surface of this laptop. My old dell was textured and it worked fine. The only surface it will work on is the built in mouse itself. Also when i'm on YouTube and I start a video it does a 5 second glitch fest when starting and ending a video. I think its just starting computer hiccups. One thing that I really like is the back-lit keyboard. Iv'e never had one and now that I do it's super cool. I do hope dell looks at this review about the wireless mouse not working. that was a bummer because now ill have to cut out a mouse pad to it's shape and if I leave it in the laptop wont close and it's gonna be really annoying to carry a round. I hope I find more amazing things about this laptop as I explore.========================================UPDATE============================================================I am becoming displeased with this laptop. I was trying to play a game called Stardew Valley (AMAZING GAME by the way) and whenever I had to shut it to do something else the screen would freeze and I would have to restart it, losing all my progress since last save. and sadly in stardew valley there isn't any save button. I'm in limbo If I should return it And get a new one or what.	3	9	3	8	0
I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it.It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it.

Got this as workstation and as a gaming device, to replace my now aging desktop pc. I could have updated the CPU, motherboard, memory and video card, and get another desktop, but just the video cards nowadays cost about 1200 dollars; so the thing was not feasible, and went for a laptop; in the meantime that prices go back to normal.The whole thing is solid; heavy; and give you a great feel of being resilient when you use it. The trackpad is decently sized and works fine; although it is not super precise, but I use the laptop mostly as desktop replacement, connected to wireless mouse and keyboard.The LCD screen is pretty nice and bright; refresh rate is great; and works fine for most of the activities; but I have the laptop connected to a bigger monitor on my desk, so I don't use it all the time. Colors are pretty bright and vivid; took a bit to calibrate it but then you can let it be and enjoy it.The keyboard is awesome; I feel very comfortable typing on it; and the resistance and spacing of the keys is perfect for me (I have big hands); I still make mistakes because the layout of the keyboard on the right side is not the same as a standard PC keyboard; but once you remember that the delete key is right on top of the backspace, and that the enter key is not as big as it was, then it is a breeze. Plus it has a ton of light settings; not a fan of flashy ones, but the red hue is quite nice.CPU and GPU works great; got some awesome results from 3dsmax, Visual Studio and other Adobe apps like Photoshop and Dimension; which made me very happy, since the main usage of this computer is portable graphic workstation. Unity works great too, and with 16 GB of RAM, you have plenty to run concurrent and memory-intensive apps.SSD is small; and it is weird since it is a raid made of 2x128 GB M2 drive; but it works fast and it is fine for me. The computer has a 1 TB mechanical drive, which won't win any contest for speed, but it is reliable and awesome to have inside the computer, to store large amount of data.The computer comes with a DVD combo drive, which can be swapped for an extra fan; I did ditch both and got an extra caddy to put an extra SATA SSD drive; and the process was painless. Now I have 2 TB of storage plus the 256 GB of system drive, and all without opening the laptop or buy external enclosures.Sound is OK; I didn't buy it for that, the internal audio card works as expected with headphones; and the internal speakers are quite loud and nice to listen to; but for movie watching, use your headphones.The fan is not that loud; not sure where you live, but in my office room, with everything else going on, I can't hear it at all, even when it is full throttle. I never got the laptop very hot, neither when playing games nor rendering in 3dsmax or working in Unity; so I guess I was lucky with the thermal compound job they did at the factory.Games run fast here; got Witcher 3 at max details and it runs smooth as silk; same for other games that are very demanding, like Tomb Raider. The scores for 3dmark are a bit lower than a desktop overclocked 1070 with an i7 8th gen; due to the fact that the laptop versions are usually clocked lower for power and heat management issues, but I won't loose my sleep for few frames lost. If you are a purist, get a desktop computer.Battery life is a joke, but this is a desktop replacement. The main issue is the lack of energy saving process, which would switch to the Intel onboard GPU, but this does not happen; the 1070 is always on and this means that the battery goes down fast (about 2.5 hours of usage, 50m if rendering). Plugged in, no problem, but if you plan to move around with this beast in tow; keep in mind that you need to be close to a plug most of the time (although in this case, you would get an ultra light model).Software onboard was not super intrusive; I did remove the extras I do not need; and left the Acer app, that is great for backup, restore and overall managing the computer drivers and get the info like serial number and such. W10 works just fine.It has 4 USB3 ports on the sides, and 1 USB-C Thunderbolt; so if you plan to use an external GPU one day, you can do so. Future proof is great.The other ports are the power connector; a SD card reader (always welcome to avoid to use a dongle), and a display port (full port, thank God) and a HDMI port, with the LAN port to guarantee connectivity at top speed. It has also a mic and headphone jack, which are also great.VR works great on this computer; the Rift runs smooth and nicely; setup was easy and also using external monitors works great (got an ultra-wide screen connected to it).In conclusion; great specs, decent price for what you get, and VR ready; perfect as game machine and as workstation; can't really complain much about anything.	4	7	5	8	0
"Love it. Got it on sale after knowing I'd not be able to afford a 17"" with the graphics I wanted to last for a few years. Excellent screen viewable from all angles and at least 10' away with colors still looking the same even at 45 degree angle and over 6' away. Keyboard feels awesome, very tactile with a nice feel to know when you activate a key. Sound is at least average, but I usually use headphones which get plenty loud too. It's not filled with bloatware which is a nice surprise, does have software preloaded but it's things people might actually use like Office, Polaris Office and some gaming stuff which is reasonable as people are likely to use this for gaming. The build feels solid and there's just a fraction of an inch of lift from the bottom when lifting just the lid. I like the arrow keys are shifted down just a bit to make them easier to find/use. Track pad feels really smooth and nice to use, it looks like it doesn't have dedicated left/right but it does they are just recessed and surprisingly easy to use and feel great.Not a fan of red back lit keyboard, but red seems to be the color of the moment and you can turn it off, which is great in a lit area otherwise you better know where your keys are. My one complaint is there's no End key outside of the one on the Numberpad with Num Lock off. I use it a lot in both typing and spreadsheets to get around with just the keyboard. There is still the End on the Num pad, but that's Num Lock off, End, Num Lock on (to avoid future errors especially which spreadsheets). Also doesn't have Page Up/Down buttons except on the Num Pad."	4	7	3	8	0
It's a good note book. I was disappointed in that the Microsoft word and Excel is temporary with the tablet. They will ask me to but the software I am sure.	3	0	0	7	5
Its a small laptop. 11.6in is really all one needs for a computer that will do basic projects, word processing, and excel spreadsheets. I would suggest something slightly larger for a person with larger hands. The keyboard is adequate, but slightly cumbersome. Windows 10 is utilized for a touchscreen, and as such should be used with a touchscreen. This is not a touchscreen but provides decent battery life. 4/5 stars. Perfect practicality but much desire left unsatisfied.	2	0	0	1	5
Bought this as a Xmas gift. Worked for 20 minutes then died. Won't power up, nothing completely dead. Thought maybe it was in hibernation mode but alas its dead. Will try to get a refund, no desire to get a replacement.	2	0	0	1	5
I Love this Surface Laptop but I only use it in tablet mode. I'm sure there are lots of things it does but I mostly use it to read news and surf the web.As I get more comfortable with it I'll find other uses for it. I highly recommend Microsoft Surface Laptop/Tablet.	2	7	2	3	3
The computer was nice but the battery is faulty. I don't know if I just got a bad batch but the battery wouldn't even last for one movie. I don't see the point in having a laptop that I have to keep plugged in the entire time. I would recommend splurging for the next level up on this computer.	3	7	2	8	0
This is a great Windows laptop. I wish it had come with a little documentation (especially for how to take advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro), but Microsoft support was able to take care of that for me. It feels and performs great. I had ordered a Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 with an i7 processor, and that got too hot to comfortably use in my lap on the sofa. The Surface laptop is perfect for me.	2	8	2	3	3
"Advertised as ""FREE 1yr Office 365 Subscription Included""That is NOT true. I contacted Asus and they said ""After reviewing the serial number on your case, I have verified that this particular unit did not leave the Manufacturing Facility with a one year Office subscription. If the unit was advertised with the said offer you should consult your place of purchase to verify the offer code to redeem Office subscription."""	2	0	0	1	5
1 star is a bad rating and should only be reserved for garbage. I am sorry to say that is exactly what Dell is. This is the first product I have bought from them and within 6 months of purchase, the speakers/audio card is defective. After contacting servicing and sending the product into the repair center they return the product without testing the speakers which continue to show the defect. Throughout the servicing process, there was no contact other than updates and those were too few only mentioning what was done such as arrival, diagnosis, and shipping, Nothing was known about their diagnosis until after the shipping.This should tell you that Dell is absolute trash and if you value your money pay for another product. The laptop seems incredible boasting the new GPU, SSD/HDD hybrid, I7, and 16 GB RAM. These are all a scapegoat for a shoddy product masquerading as an incredible deal. If you value your money at all buy anything else. Prior to this, I had an HP laptop that lasted over 6 years and is still running, and most laptops should not have this problem within 6 months of purchase.	3	7	3	8	0
Fantastic product. This laptop is a step up from the previous product which only had the skylake 6 series. The 8th gen processor handles some really impressive things for the price. The only thing is that pesky 5400rpm hard drive. Simply buy a 2.5‚Äù ssd and a Sata to USB adapter. Plug the drive into the pc and use macrium reflect to copy the drive as soon as the computer is set up. Then pop out the old drive and insert the new ssd. It blows even my aging desktop out of the water. Even without a discreet card the graphics are impressive. It easily outputs 4K with less than 50% draw on integrated graphics. Although it might be limited for rendering and such. My biggest qualm is that the older model had a backlit keyboard that was great. I would have gladly paid 400 for this laptop if it only had that backlighting. As far as budget laptops go this acer is fantastic.	3	3	1	8	3
Very good budget gaming laptop. Took out the 1TB HDD it came with, and threw in a 128GB SSD (which I just prefer speed over storage) and had an extra 8GB of DDR4 Laptop RAM so mine is a slight upgrade from normal, but that being said for the money it's a great portable gaming machine, obviously not as good as a desktop for around the same price, but pretty damn close. I get like 80s in PUBG, 150 in CSGO, and I didn't really bench more than that because I have my main gaming desktop for that, this is just for on the go. Overall it's good, monitor sucks, but that's what you have an HDMI port for, keyboard sucks, but most laptops have an awful keyboard in my opinion, and touchpad sucks, but nobody is going to use the touchpad for gaming. All in all I love it.	3	7	3	8	0
I bought this to replace a Dell XPS 13 that died suddenly. While it doesn't have the fancy aluminum case, thin bezel and carbon fiber hand rest of the XPS, this Inspiron has a newer 8th generation processor, twice the SSD space, a touch screen and nice form flexibility. I got it all set up and have found that it has a good looking screen, reasonably fast performance for a laptop and I like the ability to use it as a laptop or as a tablet.The performance and strong features for a price point of just $650, make this a very attractive choice if you are looking for a laptop of this size.	2	7	3	3	3
Pros:cost effectivebig screenno bloat waregood ram,processor,overall configurationcons:less batterynot a very bright screensound seems to be ok and one may not like front facing speakers below the keyboardbit noisy and fan is situated at the bottom.long run review will be posted after few weeks	3	2	1	8	7
Not a fan of the windows 10 operating system. As usual everybody has the hand in the cookie jar on pre loaded software....... Battery does not last very long imo. The main thing I like is the screen size and all the buttons are tight and respond well.	4	6	4	8	3
Overall very solid laptop for its price. I've currently loved the computer as it runs smoothly and is very responsive.However, I have had a couple problems small and large. The track pad can be pretty unresponsive sometimes, minor, and the display sometimes totally freezes or black screens for no reason and forces me to restart the computer, major. This second is actually a massive pain in the ass as it can happy anytime and sometimes happen a couple times a day. Still a good computer.	3	6	3	8	0
I just got it a few days ago and already got the Hard disk (3FO). Ran all hard drive checks and still said it couldn‚Äôt find it. What a horrible purchase, I‚Äôll be returning it	3	6	2	9	3
This is the best deal I've found on an HD laptop with DDR4 memory, and RJ45 network port. The HDD can be upgraded to SSD later, as well as the memory. My only problem is that the trackpad is pretty far to the left, which I have always found is a problem for those of us who are right-handed - I keep right clicking instead of left clicking! A mouse is necessary to save your sanity.	3	9	2	8	3
Solid laptop for the price. For 8 gigs of ram and a dual core processor, it ran pretty slow in the beginning. I closed out some of the bloatware and it‚Äôs been solid. Still runs a bit slower than I expected, but overall it‚Äôs been decent. Speakers are good for a laptop. Video quality is pretty good as well.	3	6	2	9	3
"This would be a decent laptop if it had a better IPS panel. Mine had lots of light bleed and a dead pixel. Once I noticed the pixel, my eye kept going to it. Hard for me to ignore. On top of that, the color accuracy is not especially good, and even at max brightness the screen struck me as a bit dim.While the storage is nice and snappy, if you are a gamer you'll need to put in a 2.5"" hard drive if you expect to store much.Also, bear in mind this has an i5 quad core. You'll get significantly better performance with an i7. You'll run games nicely enough, but spend a little more and you'll be very satisfied. Also, the backlit keyboard is fairly dim and uneven, and the actual keys are not lit, just the space in between keys. I will say the sound is excellent.This is a fair laptop with a poor quality ISP panel."	3	7	3	3	0
So far so good! I purchased this laptop for my daughter that is a college student. She has had it for almost a week and loves it! It is light weight and easy to set up.	2	0	0	1	2
The laptop had good specs, but my laptop arrived damaged (Amazon sent me a bad item), I have had many troubles with this product, it does not work very well and others, I am not satisfied with this purchase. The item is very good.	3	7	5	8	0
Very light and easy to carry around. Would like to have more choice of colors, but it only offers one color. The cursor is quite sensitive and easy to navigate, comes with a HDMI port so that you can stream videos to big screen HDTV. (needs a micro-HDMI to HDMI converter, not provided with this product). ASUS gestures provides more convenient way to move around the key board. One thing could be improved is that the CAP Lock key provides no indication when it is pressed.	2	0	0	1	5
So far no complaints. About 2 weeks in so far and this laptop has peformed beyond what I expected. Not sure why everone is getting the wrong graphics card as mine definitely has the Ti. I mostly use this laptop for steam games and streaming online and so far it runs SpinTires and Rocket League at highest graphics settings while also running the webcam and recoeding software. Great laptop for the price!	3	6	3	3	0
It's great! Light! So easy to use, I bought it for my mother because she is technically challenged and she hasn't one bit of difficulty with it. Highly recommend!	3	1	0	0	2
I like the low weight, thin profile, very bright screen, 4:3 screen size and responsive keyboard and track pad. If you use Google apps or Chrome IOS, this is the Chrome Book to get.	1	1	0	1	4
This piece of crap gets absolutely NO stars from me. I used it 3 times in 2 months and it crashed and now it won't work. Manufacturer wants me to send it in to be fixed.

HUGE disappointment.	2	0	0	1	5
"I've had an ASUS Zenbook for about a year and a half¬†ASUS ZenBook UX303UA 13.3-Inch FHD Touchscreen Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 10 (64 bit)¬†That I've really liked and been happy with. It's smaller than this ASUS laptop, but has similar specs for processor and RAM power. My Zenbook was my first laptop with a SSD drive instead of a hard-drive, and while I do really like it and am happy with it, I'm always worried I'll use up all the space on the SSD and so I end up relying on Microsoft cloud storage much more than I'd like to. I saw this ASUS with a 1 TB hard drive - which is pretty huge - and decided to snap it up. We're using it as our ""family"" computer, and sort of the central repository for documents, photos, etc. We use it directly, but also access it via our home network for stuff. It's easy to work with and so far seeming to be a really nice laptop. A few years ago I avoided ASUS, thinking they were crappy despite the many good reviews. However, I've since changed my opinion and have become a big ASUS fan, with now 2 ASUS computers and 3 ASUS zenfones. So, here's why I've had a change of heart along with my review which leans heavily on comparing this laptop with my ASUS Zenbook.....My history with ASUS and why I went from hating them to loving them:Originally, way back when, my husband had a couple of ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy because he went through two of them within a years time as they'd always malfunction. Well, we realized it's him - seriously! - there's something about him and the windows platform that doesn't work well together and he seems to just kill all his microsoft computers (even his work issued Dell dies and malfunctions constantly when he has to work from home). For home use he switched to a Mac (which I despise, but to each his own...) and he's been a happy camper for 3 years now - a record for him!Meanwhile, a little over a year and a half ago I nervously bought an ASUS Zenbook after having disappointing performance & two BUS replacements due to factory build issues on a thinkpad within a year of (very expensive) purchase, followed by repeated fan failure on an HP after only 2 months (the HP was supposed to be the replacement for the crappy thinkpad). I then sought out what had the best reviews for a small, lightweight laptop that also had strong performance and reliability, and at that time the ASUS kept coming up again and again, with the Zenbook being their smallest/lightest version. The Zenbook has been great, much more hearty and stable than all my various past laptops, and is able to handle the 100+ tabs I often have open in my browser when researching (I kid you not, the last onetab app gathering up of tabs I had 181 open tabs, plus MSword open, pdf reader open and it was running fine and dandy!). I even ended up getting 3 ASUS zenphones because of my positive experience - and we love those as well! We have two¬†Asus ZenFone 3 ZE520KL Unlocked Dual Sim Phone, 32GB, 5.2-inch, 3GB RAM, No Warranty - International Version (Moonlight White)¬†and one deluxe¬†ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.7-inch AMOLED FHD display, 6GB RAM 64GB storage Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone, US Warranty (ZS570KL-Glacier Silver)¬†(I have the deluxe and love, love, love it!). Anyways, the point is I'm now a fully on board ASUS fan having had no problems and superior performance on all my ASUS devices over the past couple of years.THIS particular ASUS laptop:We wanted something we could store our many digital images and documents on, so something with a big hard drive (yes, I know I can just get an external hard drive for that - and we do have a few - but we wanted a laptop with a big drive built in and all the other performance features I've come to expect from my Zenbook). This met the criteria with the large drive, plus it has the same RAM and processor I've got in my Zenbook. My Zenbook has touch screen and this does not, but in the grand scheme of things I really don't use my touchscreen all that much. This has a long battery life, just like my Zenbook - unlike many computers that report a long battery life but in reality drain quickly, I've found my Zenbook to really and truly have a long battery life & so far this one has a similar reliability, although we don't use it on battery all that much. This is bigger, 15.6"" vs 13.3"" and 2lbs heavier than my Zenbook but still pretty lightweight for a bigger laptop & can easily be transported around. Should my Zenbook die (please say no) I'd have no issues taking this laptop on an airplane with me on a trip.This has TPM security & I honestly don't know what that is so I can't comment on that. It also has a fingerprint reader, and like the one on my Zenfone it works pretty well (wet fingers are the only time I find a challenge, so I have to do an extra drying after washing hands, etc. if I want it to read my print). The wifi connection and speed seems no different between this and my Zenbook and both clock the same speeds on our internet connection. I will say it doesn't start up instantly like my Zenbook does, but I think that's related to having a SSD drive vs a hard drive, as I believe that is a benefit to an SSD drive. However, it's not like it takes a prolonged amount of time to start up - for a laptop with a hard drive I believe it's where it should be.Special features of this laptop:There are special features on this computer since it's marketed as a ""business"" laptop. You can wake it over a network (something I'm not likely to do & haven't used so can't speak to this), and it has an easily accessed inside so that you can upgrade RAM. The battery is removable - something that used to be standard with most laptops and is now rare. I suppose if you travel it may be helpful to have an extra and swap it out? This, again, is a feature I don't really need or use. There is also an additional ""business"" app that ASUS put on there that's supposed to help when using this as a business laptop - I don't use this. I think generally heavy business users are more productive on systems that are faster and more powerful (the processor and RAM) and that's most of why they're calling this a business laptop. However, unless you solely read email and surf the internet I think those are important features for most users and allow the flexibility to use it for most anything you might want. I think that also makes it possibly a good computer for entry level gamers, too.Possible use for gaming??My daughter has an Alienware, which is optimized for gaming. Gaming is intense on your onboard systems and so need stronger computers to handle them well. I don't do the super action games, but my zenbook and this laptop can handle Sims4 7 minecraft on the high quality/high definition graphics & screen resolution without stuttering or issues. However, when compared to what it looks like on my daughter's Alienware hers is absolutely much more crisp, clear and defined (part of this is her screen is also higher resolution even though my computer is high definition), and she has special memory and drivers allocated to graphics. However, I don't know how well this or my Zenbook would do on Overwatch and other fast moving online gaming platforms. BUT! Before she had her Alienware she was able to play Overwatch on a computer that had similar specs to what my Zenbook has, just at lower graphics. This makes me think that this laptop *might* be a good, low cost option for gaming for an entry level gamer - especially since it's easy to access the innards and upgrade RAM. Something to consider for those who aren't willing to fork out the big $$$ for expensive gaming laptops (although I will say we initially weren't willing to spend the money, but eventually we caved and bought the Alienware for our daughter and she definitely has less power issues, better graphics and better timing responses when gaming while also being able to use it for school and everything else needed...).For StudentsThis is a great option for students, esp. college students for a low cost yet powerful laptop that can handle most anything they need. There is plenty of room for tons of documents (reports, class notes, downloaded documents, etc.) and it can handle having multitudes of tabs open for students who are doing a lot of research online. It also easily handles having several applications open at once along with the multiple tabs (Typically I'll have Word, Powerpoint, PDF reader, File explorer, and my browser with at least 30+ tabs open at once - and often two browsers, chrome and firefox, all at the same time. I teach online & do a lot of course and assignment creation, thus the many programs all open at once. As mentioned above, it also handles some gaming, although they may need to optimize it by adding stuff for fast paced gaming like Overwatch and FPS games.Lastly, from experience a few years back, when my husband kept killing his ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy - the customer service for repairs was good and sending in computers for repairs had a quick turn-around (under 2 weeks including mailing time both ways). However, we live in the SF Bay area and for us the repair center was also in the SF Bay area - perhaps it would be longer for folks who aren't so close to an ASUS repair center.SUMMARY: Nice, powerful, easy to use yet inexpensive laptop from a company that has demonstrated solid, reliable computers & phones. Great for Business users, students, and anyone wanting a fast & powerful laptop at a low cost. Reccommended."	3	9	2	8	3
Very serious overheat problem,came out of the box and when first used the cpu almost reached 100 degrees.needed to update bios in order to try to solve the problem,but not solved it entirely the computer still overheats during charging.turns out that the problem is common for this model after a short google search.also the battery life is like 6 hours and not 12 as reviewed. I was very disappointed from this computer,not worth the money.	2	6	3	3	3
I bought this computer last month as a replacement for my Dell, and so far it's been great. It runs my games perfectly, and the speed is incredible. My only complaints involve the fan. When I run most of my games on it (primarily WoW, D3,), the fan gets really loud and the computer gets very hot. I'm a little concerned about it overheating, but after a few minutes it starts to cool down. Otherwise, a great computer for a great price.	3	6	5	8	0
I have had this laptop for a few days now and I love it! It is very fast. The only thing that I wish it had (and I knew this before purchasing) is a numeric keypad, so I have to use the number buttons on the top. The fingerprint scanner is also a very nice feature.	2	7	3	8	3
First off, this laptop surpassed my expectations, playing almost every game on the highest settings. And even being able to play VR Games with ease.It's a beautiful machine, and when combined with a fan cooler that goes below the laptop (the fans blow downward), it stays cool. I wouldn't try off-battery gaming, since the laptop will use the Intell Graphics card rather than the GTX to save battery life.As a standard laptop, it's slightly larger than some, but will last for about four hours without battery (using it for four hours straight).There is no trade off here, other than the CPU having no fans for cooling. It's an amazing laptop, and I highly recommend it.	3	7	2	8	0
Purchased for me by my husband who does computers for a living. After weeks of negotiating on what I wanted and what I needed and why I did NOT want a gaming system, this is perfect. And the right price point for me. I am a writer and handle our family's household needs, and this is perfect.	3	9	2	8	3
Wow what a fantastic computer! Updated it and starting throwing down on mechs right out of the box. Love it. Will probably add HDD in the future. It is well worth the money because I'm totally on a budget.	3	6	3	3	0
I really like how fast this computer is! I dabble in a few computer games. Mostly SC2. I can easily run it on high settings without a dedicated graphics card. I love using the tablet mode at work! The only down side is the battery life. I usually average about 5 hours with regular use.	2	6	3	3	3
So far, one of the most beautiful computing devices I have owned so far. That's a real statement considering I have owned more than 15 laptops in the past decade.The screen is a stunner, touchpad and keyboard are simply fantastic and the sound is surprisingly loud and clear. The ports leave a lot to be desired but isn't a deal breaker. Although I have yet to confirm true daily performance and battery life, so far it has been overwhelmingly positive. I only felt this when I had ordered the Dell XPS ultrathin but was quickly reminded of its deal breaking limitations.You'll want to show this off and will equally enjoy using it as your daily driver. Definitely remember to use the free upgrade to Windows 10 pro until the S version has a store that is well populated with the most critical windows apps for power users and general users alike.	2	7	2	3	3
This item was delivered on August 7th, 2017.As advertised this laptop is extremely light, and also very fast.I discounted a few stars because:- The colors are weird. Sometimes they look dull and other times they are just simply wrong. Tried using Intel HD Graphics Control Panel to match the settings with those of an older ASUS laptop but they seemed to be the same already.*After some Windows update, the colors are better but there's still a faint yellowish tint. Haven't tried BIOS reset yet.-The box it was delivered in alongside with an external CD reader was too big and with little to no protection. The order was handled by amazon, thought.Side note:- The plug is on the power brick, which might be inconvenient in some situations.- The audio is very nice, but the location of the speakers makes it so that they may get covered when typing.- NO CAPS LOCK LIGHT OR ALERT.	2	7	3	8	3
"Computer seems nice, I just wish I could use it. Upon starting it up and getting my account connected it started to install windows updates, and failed repeatedly. It got to the point where it said it was ""preparing to upgrade"" and was stuck at 9% for hours. Currently been working on this for 12 hours total. It would not let me modify/install other programs while it was stuck so I couldn't just live with it either. I tried restarting the computer and the update status never changed, right at 9 % when the computer was turned back on. Currently doing a reset process just so I can get it working at least, hopefully I won't just be restarting another 12 hour process. Should not have to spend this much time right out of the box just to get it to run, quite infuriating. If the current patches are problematic could this computer not be shipped pre-updated?As I said before, it seems like it would be a nice computer if it just ran like it's supposed to.Edit 1:Still unable to get most recent version of windows running, but am running stable at an older version. May have to try a clean install of windows but I'm not looking forward to getting all the drivers this thing needs back on it if I do. Additional issue, the track pad has terrible drift. About 10% of the time when I click while I still have my finger on the track pad, it causes the cursor to shoot across the screen without my finger on the pad moving at all.Strongly considering returning at this point. Highly disappointing for a nearly $2000 laptop."	3	7	2	8	0
Order this and when it got delivered it was not as described this was not a touch screen Chromebook like it says in the description!!!It was also very glitchy and not working accurately stay away from HP products they are no good this is the third HP product that I have bought and returned because due to lack of performance and defects definitely not worth buying	0	9	0	0	2

Don't waste your time with their PCs. They have good options but terrible design, but parts and no reasonable support. They have terrible keyboard and GSU problems now! You can almost be guaranteed you will have problem with keys not working while it's still under warranty. You will have to send your PC to them, bouncing it across the country with UPS drop kicking it along the way and back, then you will get it back with the same problems occurring! Who wants to put their new PC through all this? It becomes a perpetual problem and you will never get everything resolved or want to keep sending it back, so you may put up with problems because of it. This is no way to spend time or money on a product when the people servicing it just DON'T CARE!! STAY AWAY!	3	7	2	8	0
There is something really wrong with this Lenovo. Keys get stuck so you can't use keyboard. Had it for about a month before the issue started but you hit one key and get a completely different letter or other times it seems like the function key is stuck on all the time so press a key and it triggers a function. Read that a lot of others have had the same experience. That aside it wasn't very user-friendly. Spend a little more for a quality product...spending money on this is like.tossing money out the window.	0	9	0	2	4
Laptop came with a myriad of issues.TrackPad felt and looked loose. An absurd amount of pressure was needed for the left click to register.Overall performance was lacking especially for a machine with these specs (start up time >4 minutes, opening browser > 30 seconds, opening Word >1 minute, YouTube videos buffered forever even on multiple reliable WiFi connections).After troubleshooting, the following issues were found:1. When running Lenovo Vantage Health & Support hardware scan, the laptop would freeze, restart itself without warning and show the blue screen of death with the following error message: DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE2.Started the laptop in safe mode, uninstalled and corrected the faulty drivers (Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 Wireless Network Adapter, Generic PnP monitor, System Interface Foundation Device) yet the issues still lingered.3. Windows updates would not install. Running the Windows Reapir Tool did not resolve the issue. PC reset did not fix it as well.Pretty freaking annoying; not what I expected at all.	3	2	1	8	7
CPU problem, fan overruns most of the time (even when simple websites in use) over %100, freezing and not responding to mouse pad. Returned for an another unit...	3	7	2	8	4
I love this computer for the most part, speakers aren't that loud and the fan can be loud, but my mouse pad won't work properly sometimes and my HDMI port doesn't work. Sound through the headphone jack is low too. I found out about the HDMI port not working while I tried hooking up my computer for a class presentation. I'll probably have to send my computer in to get fixed and once the mouse pad and HDMI port gets fixed then I'll update this review to 5 stars. This is a great computer for the most part, I think I just got a lemon. I'm not rough with my computer at all and I've never dropped it either.	2	7	3	8	3
If you buy this I think you'll be disappointed. It does what it promises, but not very well. It is oh so very slow. The WIFI is slow, no matter how I connect. The keyboard reduces me to a two finger hunt and peck (I normal type at nearly 70 wpm). It runs Android apps... sort of. The apps are buggy and some fail to display key features. The apps are good, and work perfectly on an Android device. They just don't work right on this device. It sucks when you load up an app and then can't do anything but restart because the app doesn't provide a menu. I was hoping for a portable device that would be easier to manage than a smart phone, particularly for things that require lots of keyboard activity. The Chromebook isn't it. I rarely use it.	1	1	0	1	4
The battery life is crazy, it really goes all day. But it's lacking in processing power and the resolution takes a little to get used to. Webpages act a little strange, the headers sometimes take up massive chunks of the screen even when you scroll down. But it works well enough and you can do homework all day and hate your life while being productive. So that's...nice?	3	1	0	0	2
This is my second chromebook, and I love it. Super light, high-resolution (2k 'retina')display in 2/3 dimensions for better web page viewing and a great tablet configuration. This is the Chromebook perfection I have been waiting for with android installed natively. I'm looking forward to where these chromebook/tablets are going to go. Right now, nothing does this better on this platform. I'm looking forward to a slightly better camera. It serves its purpose but if you want to do hd conference calls or webcasts you will still need to get a decent clip on camera. The wide angle of this camera is unappealing, this is matched with poor ISO performance and a really contrasty image. Other than that, this is a pretty slick device and is great for showing off work to your clients and stakeholders.	1	1	0	1	4
It's a cheap laptop with basic specs, and it does not outperform expectations. Resolution is decent at low brightness; speakers are nothing special; and Windows 10 has shown me that Microsoft has not fixed the issues that plagued its operating systems half a decade ago.	2	0	0	1	5
As a designer I thought this would be a nice computer to do my work but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs way too slow, even without any program opened. And I don‚Äôt know why, it‚Äôs supposed to be fast.... I mean it‚Äôs new... I tried to work with only one program opened and internet and it was hell. I got frustrated...	3	9	3	8	1
"If there was a ""no stars"" rating, I would have used it on this purchase. On the advice from folks that know more than I do about identity theft, I bought it to use as a dedicated machine for our online banking only and nothing else. It has a 32g flash memory, the same thing used in phones and tablets, in place of a serious hard drive. In other words, it uses a multimedia card in place of a drive. Now, the problem with this idea is that 28g of this space is necessary for the operating system. With this setup, there is only 4g left for anything else. It is not only slow, but hasn't enough storage space to update even the operating system. We have very, very minimal software installed; A browser for getting online and the software necessary to pay bills, etc. on line. It is not able to update anything for lack of space to do the work. I can't imagine what this machine could possibly be good for.The only plus in this purchase is that I learned a $200 lesson in emmc theory and operation. Bottom line; Do some research first."	2	0	0	1	2
I wanted to wait a few months before I reviewed this because I've had experience with cheaper laptops being very short lived, so far this one is fine though. I like it quite a lot. It's faster than I was led to believe by other reviews, and yes it could use some more memory but over all there's no problem, at least not so far. I bought it mainly for traveling since I prefer a desktop at home, and have now made 3 trips with it, and it's worked just fine!	3	9	2	8	3
"TINY speakers with very poor volume - You can barely have a zoom call without headphones. Printing is a nightmare if your printer is not google chrome compatible. You can not save photo files from the web as .jpgs. Since it has no regular USD you need adaptors for every hard drive or external connection. The guy at best buy said ""A chrombook is not a computer, it is a glorified web browser"" and the longer I used it, the more I found that to be true. I would never ever buy a chromebook again, its just way too limited in what it can do."	1	1	0	1	4
Loving it! Although it lags a little bit and that some of its features such as the android apps compatibility is not working so well, as a laptop with light weight and that is 360¬∞ reversible, it is pretty awesome. It has been 3 days so far and my friends liked then design of it as well as the fact that I can use it to take notes in class without being distractful to others.	1	1	0	1	4
I purchased this Chromebook for online classes primarily. I already utilized google apps and programs prior when I had an android phone. You can't download any kind of software or anything to it, which is why there's so little space on the hard drive. It's not necessary. You do get up to 100GB of storage space on your google drive for a year or two though. For school purposes, I use Office Online since I can't download the actual software to the computer, and it works pretty much just the same. I also use it for facebook, email, shopping, etc.. It can definitely be a tiny bit slow if you're trying to look at a ton of stuff at once. I had to disable the autoplay on my facebook so it doesn't play the videos automatically and slow it down. But all in all, this does exactly what I purchased it for. I have a regular laptop if I need any additional processing power or storage space.The laptop may be refurbished, but it came in perfect condition. No scratches or dents, and no issues with the way it runs at all.	3	1	0	0	2
Had it in top-notch condition, running smoothly and plays all the games I throw at it. Its a Really good bang for your buck. But the color acuracy is not the best if you intend to do video editing	3	7	2	8	0
I love the trackpad, super silcky. Love the keyboard. The keyboard has good depth and feedback, and the layout is what I'm used to on my desktop.The screen is too reflective. It is fine in low light and when there is a white background (which there typically is in most apps). I do use the laptop outside, so it is usable, there are just times when the reflection is too apparent, and interferes with seeing the screen.It looks very sleek and feels very solid. When I sit in certain positions with the laptop on my lap (go figure), the edges cut into my hands or wrists uncomfortably. It doesn't happen often, but it seems very unnecessary to be so sharp.The performance is great. I have 25 tabs open right now with no problem and only 8GB of memory.	3	5	2	3	3
"Just received the HP Chromebook....I understand that it's a refurbished product, BUT for it to look as extremely used buy everyone in the world is very disappointing. I thought I was going to get a Chrome colored unit, but instead I received a dingy white one that's all scratched up and discolored! I didn't even want to turn it on! Once I turned it on, it seemed to work fine, but found out that it doesn't even have a ""Caps Lock"" button! Wow. Never again. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!"	2	1	0	0	4

I bought this laptop as my husband's Christmas present. The computer was delivered as promised. Then two days later the Microsoft suite for Home was delivered. When my husband turned on the laptop to begin to load it the Microsoft Suite I had purchase, the laptop locked with a message from Microsoft that the computer had a virus in it and the Microsoft Key was not to be used in this computer. Now, my husband does not have his new laptop for Christmas because we are unable to open it, download a thing, or work with it. Microsoft now wants $400 <> from us to clear the computer. This computer came with this defect and we were not able to even do a thing to it. I also paid with my Discover card the bill which I had over $176.00 in bonus for using my card and if I returned the computer to you this money will disappear! PLEASE TELL ME WHAT AND HOW CAN I FIX THIS PROBLEM. I am a good Amazon Prime customer and have been for many years now.	4	6	1	8	3
This is a pretty good tablet/laptop. The colors and brightness of the screen are vivid and the touch screen is responsive. Build quality is quite good too. It‚Äôs seems like the hinges will hold up long term when converting it to a tablet as long as you are gentle when folding it.	2	9	0	2	2
Fantatic beast of a laptop, it completely out performs my desktop which I put together just 3 years ago. It disperses the heat of the cpu/gpu very well, so much so that I have played a high demaind game whil the laptop was actually on my lap.	3	6	3	3	0
What a flop! I bought this for my daughter for Christmas since she decided to go back to college. I bought this in November, gave it to her on Christmas, and the monitor was dead by January. Reached out to Lenovo to get warranty work done as this laptop comes with a 1 year warranty only to have the service tickets cancelled without notice.The computer and the customer service both STINK!	3	9	2	8	6
I have been using this Chromebook plus for a little over two weeks. If I didn't know better, I would think it had a virus. Once a day, out of the blue, the image will start jumping around and the only control that will work is the on off switch on side for the computer. Turning off does not seem to help but eventually the shacking goes away.I have not contacted Samsung or Google yet as I don't really know the best approach to use. I like the construction quality of the device and want to like using the device. I have noticed it seems to help when I clear browsing history.I guess my main problem is the system seems to be unstable. I browse the internet, check the news, email, pay bills and use Google Docs. Pretty simple stuff. I didn't see the shaky image and then freeze up as something I would have to deal with.I am going to continue trying to work out my kinks but I am disappointed at this point. I want to make it work.	1	1	0	1	4
Buyer beware: this hunk of junk cannot skype. It has a camera, and it is 2016, so logic would suggest that it can, it cant. Chrome just doesn't allow it. I will be selling this at a loss and replacing with a full feature laptop. This should only be purchased for internet browsing.	2	1	0	0	4
Not as much bloatware as I assumed would be on it, it actually is a good deal and works well. Easy to set up [Cotana starts yammering upon plugging it in] and just as easy to remove all the unnecessary junk and run faster. Happy with it overall and would recommend to others.	3	9	3	9	3
So far so good. No complaints. Works as expected with no hiccups. Did have a lot of bloatware but was able to remove most of it and have adequate space to function and run quickly.	2	1	0	1	7
I love this unit and it is at a great price with many features. I would recommend upgrading the ram for serious gaming easy to put in. The screen to me is a bit washed out but can be adjusted with effort. Overall you cannot beat price and quality highly recommended.	3	9	3	8	0
Second MSI I have purchased. I am a true believer in these machines. Well built, well priced, and a monster at gaming. Benchmarks very will, not even just as a laptop. but a PC.	3	7	2	8	0
A little heavy for my preference. It does have a bigger screen, so it makes up for it.Also, it seems like is large enough to have a ten key, but they didn't include it.Everything else about this computer is awesome. It's fast and very comfortable to type on and runs programs without issues. Not too much bloatware either.I'd recommend it.	3	5	2	3	3
Very slow, partially due to not having Windows configured at all. Waste of time 5400 HDD, don't even bother. Did not recognize GSkill DRAM of proper spec. DDR3L DRAM when the chipset and CPU clearly would support DDR4. BIOS is terrible and almost non-existent. Fitted with an NVMe m.2 socket but advised that only SATA is supported. Screen is marginally acceptable but bad. The viewing angle is so poor you can't even get a same-tint background all the way across the screen. I sent it back and won't be buying another ACER. Support material is TERRIBLE and printed in text so small you need a microscope. The 8th Gen i3 is adequate, but theentire system is lacking. Misc detail - The Mobo is a KBL Ironman_SK and the DRAM timing as delivered is 11-11-11-28. Perhaps Acer will fix this in the next iteration. Very glad I didn't spend more to get the i5 with the screen the way it is. ~~	3	3	1	8	3
"Purchased this in April. At first I was very happy with it, it seemed to be pretty good. Had features I liked and wanted. Then about a 4-5 weeks after buying, that's when it all went bad. PHANTOM TOUCHES!!! You'll be using it, and then all of a sudden the display starts to spaz out. Jumping around, phantom key presses. It will continue until you force power it off. Then when you restart it sometimes goes away for awhile. However, it comes back. This is not an isolated issue, it's actually quite common among this Chromebook. Just Google ""Chromebook plus phantom"", and you'll see tons of complaints and videos about it. It's a huge flaw, and Samsung isn't properly addressing the issue. All they do is tell you to send the notebook in to be repaired, which takes like 2-4 weeks. And they don't fix the issue, because it starts all over again. This product is garbage, and Samsung is washing their hands with the issue. Amazon should remove this product considering how widespread the issues are. DO NOT BUY, you have been warned.Pros:- Stylus- Bright, vivid display- Decent keyboard- Build qualityCons:- PHANTOM TOUCHES/KEYPRESSES- Poor connectivity, wifi doesn't always work, even when it shows you're connected- Samsung's lack of support- Not enough cpu/gpu power to drive the high resolution display. Often becomes sluggish or choppy- Wifi doesn't seem to work while bluetooth is enabled. So much for listening to Pandora. through BT speaker."	1	1	0	1	4
Received the computer very quickly and it has been as expected so far. That said, it came with absolutely zero paperwork of any kind. Literally nothing. No confirmation of any software that the software installed is legitimate. Contacted Amazon support and they confirmed it was a new machine purchased from Dell by Amazon and sold to me - but unfortunately they had no proof of licensure that could be provided. First time I have purchased a computer using Amazon and I intentionally bought from Amazon directly. Hard to believe this was the answer but it is what it is I guess. Buyer beware when purchasing from Amazon I guess is the answer.	2	7	3	3	3
Needed a new computer for grad school that could handle some of the modeling programs that my 6 year old computer couldn't because of the graphics card. Nvidia with intel is a nice combo for getting the job well done. The only problem I had was the delivery of the laptop. The package delivery area was under construction and the delivery person left it unattended in the construction zone, when there were signs posted informing deliveries to be put in another area.	3	7	3	8	0

Don‚Äôt get me wrong: this laptop is light years ahead of any computer I have ever owned.

Super fast and plenty of memory for my needs using this as my work only laptop. My only critique (and it's not really important) is that this laptop is much heavier than similar machines.	3	9	2	3	3
First the main board went out (in less than 3 months), Acer took care of it...I had to pay the $40 shipping.Now there is another issue (we have had laptop since Christmas) and Acer is giving me the run around.	3	7	3	8	6
Within a day of receiving the product, the display started freezing constantly, especially when playing a video or using any browser. Basically, it halts for anywhere from 5 to 40 seconds and seems to happen more frequently when you move from one application to another, or even between tabs on a browser. A few months in, this has not resolved at all and has gotten worse. The computer occasionally functions even more poorly than my 6 year old raggedy laptop that I was switching off of - seriously. Luckily I haven't experienced any forced shutdowns, BUT, there have been about 3-5 times when the laptop completely freezes for minutes, forcing ME to shut it down... Extremely disappointing and disgusting for what should be a decently powerful comp.Video games function well, however; if you plan to use this laptop PURELY for gaming, then it may be worth the few hundred you might save over buying a newer, more reliable version.Otherwise, go for the most updated product. This is my only experience with their gaming laptops, but Dell's general purpose products have been above average experiences for me. In this space, it seems like Dell might suck for gaming.	3	9	3	8	0
Don't buy this laptop. I am highly disappointed with this product. I purchased one as a backup to my work laptop and one for a client as a closing gift. I've only had it a week when it started to lag and freeze. Storage is horrible and other than how pretty it is, it may as well just be kept in a display case since it doesn't function properly. I just received a text from my client asking me if I purchased a warranty. Luckily, I can take them back. Such an inconvenience.	2	1	0	1	7
Windows 10 is simply terrible. The computer itself may be OK but the constant annoyances from Win 10 make this a regrettable purchase. My local geeks have worked with me to make the display as Windows Seven-ish as possible but that is only SOME help. MS has gotten way too intrusive into my personal decisions as the user. It refused to let me use my password of choice because it was 'seen too often.' Also the MS Edge software continues to intrude itself despite my having made the tried and true MS Explorer my browser of choice. Finally, no matter what I do, the computer continues to use Bing as the search engine despite me having changed the setting to use Google. In all probability, I am taking the machine back to my techs next week and having it erased and Windows 7 installed.	3	0	0	7	5
I purchased an Asus C300 Chromebook a couple years ago, but I needed something with Windows to write Powershell code on and connect to my company's VPN with a smart card. I also wanted something small to travel with that wasn't too expensive in case it was stolen/damaged.Here are my criticisms so far:-System came with an older version of Windows 10. It took about 5 hours to update to the latest version.-Compared to the C300, this laptop's power cord cable seems a little thinner. I'll have to make sure I'm not putting too much wear and tear on it.-11.6 inch screen is nice, but small. The keyboard keys are on the smaller side. For extended desk use, I would hook up to a keyboard/mouse/larger screen.-Disk is very small. I managed to free up 14GB of the 28GB available. Do the following to free up more space:*after the major update is complete, go to C drive and use Disk cleanup utility.*if you are exclusively going to be using google apps in the browser, remove the Office trial install to save a little extra space.Pros:-lightweight and portable-screen looks pretty good!-trackpad works pretty well-once the updates are done, laptop works pretty quickly	2	0	0	1	5

The touchpad (while sensitive enough) is delayed by the hardware. Everything is delayed. Plan your key strokes and mouse clicks a couple seconds ahead, and for the love of gosh, don't make mistakes, as correcting them takes an eternity. I'm used to a completely equipped mid 2014 MBP, an SDD upgraded Mac Mini, and a completely equipped Lenovo AIO. This sucks. I got it to prepare for the upcoming likely every country laptop ban so I can stuff it in my backpack and not care if TSA steals it, but now I kind of hope TSA steals it. I really only got it to use for mild work when I'm not not supposed to be working for email and remote desktop into my quickbooks server. Remote desktop works pretty ok, because it's realying omn the remote hardware, but man, I don't know if I can do it. Amazon doesn't allow returns of open boxes, but I'd return it if I could.	2	0	0	1	5
"Chromebooks are useless unless theyre connected. Before you buy a Plus, , do a search on ""Chrombook Plus Connectivity Issues"". You'll get countless hits and You'll also get countless ""solutions"": If this doesn't work try that... if that doesn't work, try this... well, if that doesn't work... etc. Bottom line, I am stuck with a ridiculously expensive brick. I've had cheap Chrombooks and was very pleased with them , which is why i decided to upgrade. This expensive ""upgrade"" is a disaster. Don't be fooled by the hype. The glowing reviews are for hypothetical perfect conditons. The countless complaints of ""connectivity issues"" are testimony to yet another Samsung product that was rushed to market before it's time. I suppose I'm lucky that it simply doesn't work... at least it doesn't explode like their phones. . DO NOT BUY."	1	1	0	1	4

The screen is beautiful.The best laptop today.delivery and amazon service is a little bit not up to the mark . other than amazon services definitely recommended	1	1	0	1	4
"Extremely happy with this laptop for the price. Updating review after 2 weeks. Great battery life and thin, lightweight profile. I have however, experienced a few issues with the lack of storage and trying to run windows updates. But once I started deleting the previous version of windows, cleaning up the drive, temp files and uninstalling programs I don't need, it freed up space to install more updates. I also purchased a 64GB SD card for additional storage at $20. This laptop works great for email and shopping, great picture on the display, writing papers and playing Solitaire. Love it!!! I'll update in the future if this Acer runs into problems, but so far so good. Lastly, I love the ""night light"" feature which turns the screen an amber color to block blue light after sunset so the light from the screen doesn't impact your sleep. I have my hours set from 6:30pm to 6:30am. Very pleased and I recommend this little laptop as long as you note that storage is an issue and you will have to uninstall programs and delete temp files, etc in order to keep running updates and either store everything in the cloud or on an SD card."	2	0	0	1	2

Bought this computer (about 3 months ago) because I wanted something mid range that was travel friendly and could handle basic gaming. I'm happy to say that this laptop meets all of those criteria. Super light weight and boots up fast. I can play league of legends for hours without any issue. Some points that may be helpful to some people: My computer crashed after playing games and having a video open in Chrome. From my experience the computer life is no where near what is advertised. It's more like 5-6 hours rather then 10. Also, a bit disappointed that it didn't come with a longer, more sturdy power cord with a ground. Just came with a standard two pronged power adapter. All that said though, I'm very happy with my purchase. Definitely a good buy if you're looking for something travel friendly, and something that can handle standard tasks plus a little more.	2	7	3	8	3

"This review is for the 11"" version, not the 14"" option these reviews are bundled with now. The 11"" is like a windows version of the Mac Book Air for $200 and is is amazing at that price point if you can find it direct from Amazon. I also have the older 2GB version - I liked it so much I went ahead and bought the 4GB memory one to eliminate the ""2GB is a bit tight"" when running multiple apps issues. The cases are neatly designed and feel more valuable than the plastic they're made of. I don't abuse them so they've not gotten scratched, but should survive it anyway.The Atom CPU isn't great. The 4GB of memory isn't expandable. The 32GB non-replaceable hard drive is tight. But for $200 you shouldn't care. Buy a 64-256GB EVO microSD card slot for your bulk storage, music, games, movies, etc.I'd love for Asus to make a $499 version with a 1920x1080 touch enabled screen, 4GB and and actual m2 sata slot with a user accessible hatch on the case. No twist/detach-ability needed to keep it this compact."	2	0	0	1	5
This computer took 17 minutes to start up. Called Microsoft to help me optmize the startup. First we needed to update Windows. Spent 4.5 hours on the phone with Microsoft trying to update Windows.

Had this for two days. I gave it a shot, but I will be returning it. Maybe I got a lemon, but this laptop is SOOOOOOO SLOOOOWWWW. Its like being on a dial up connection, even when right next to the router. Web pages like yahoo take 60+ seconds to load - and sometimes drops the webpage. HD display? Doesn't look like it to me. My webcam feed on this thing looks like something off of a 1970's tube TV; websites are not much better. And after a minute or so, it gets so hot I can feel it if it's on my lap. I know this isn't even a mid-range laptop in terms of processor/memory/hard drive, but come on. It's 2018. Even a bottom of the barrel laptop should have much better performance than this thing. I have had HP products in the past with no complaints, and will try HP in the future. Like I said, maybe this one is a lemon, but if this is what the true performance of this laptop is supposed to be like, I would only recommend as a first laptop for children.	2	0	0	1	4
"Get it. Great price. You WILL need a USB drive with it, even to do the updates.Make sure you turn on the ""better performance"" option in the hardware policies (a quick google search will indicate what to do). I enabled my High Performance power plan to be aggressive on the CPU, but at maximum power savings for everything else. It has a plastic body, so even when putting the wifi card to maximum savings with minimal radio signals, it gets full signal.I remember the days when even high-end computers were plastic.

I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and I tried to do my best because I don't know much about computers. Luckily, it seems I did good. He loves it.

Unfortunately, my lovely honeymoon with the Chromebook Plus has ended. This product is garbage. There are widespread touch screen issues that Samsung refuses to address (just look at the Samsung support forum). Yet, they just keep selling it. Samsung doesn't offer replacements ‚Äî only repairs. The process can take up to FOURTEEN DAYS. For a laptop I've had for less than three months. For a laptop they should stop selling. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this one.	1	1	0	1	4

I have been using this for about a month now. I like it. Great build quality. Snappy. Not all android apps work on it but enough to make it a great Laptop/Tablet/Phone hybrid. (Hangouts and Skype paired with a bluetooth over wifi will allow you to make calls.)Normal windows apps will not run on it but if you have a windows PC you can remote in to it using Chrome desktop. I have used remote desktop sessions with it to access it.	1	1	0	1	4
This laptop might be the most worthless computer I've ever owned. The 1050 in it is undoubtedly underpowered, as I can't even run Terraria on it, which is one of the lowest impact games you can get.If you restart it or have to update it, forget about using it for at least an hour, because you'll just sit and watch it load and listen to the fans blast full on for minutes before anything will load.I can build a PC that would put this thing to shame for under half the money I spent on this and I genuinly feel like I was robbed. So dissapointing.If you're getting it just for web browsing, I would recommend saving 3-4 hundred and getting a toaster, it would surely compete.	3	7	3	8	0
First off, I am an admitted IT Geek. I have a computer science degree and have spent my entire career working in IT on everything from mainframes to wearable computers. I really know computers inside and out. I want to provide some perspective about the Chromebook by a person who spends 10-12 hours on some type of computing device every day.So why would I ever buy a device like this? Well, I ordered the Chromebook to evaluate it for my parents. They are not tech savvy at all. They have a Kindle Fire and an iPad, but when they do write e-mails and want to do other tasks, the pads are just not enough. They are computer users and media consumption people. What I found out during my work with the Chromebook is that it is the right computer for me too. Now, off to the review...First off the Google Chromebook is computer unlike anything coming from the minds of Apple or Microsoft. Something on the surface that an IT Geek like me probably wouldn't like. It doesn't have a full-blown operating system like OSX nor is it a mobile platform like Android. It is something in between, it is ChromeOS. It is very fast, very reliable, and is perfect for doing your everyday tasks. If you mostly read e-mail, write notes, run spreadsheets, develop presentations, chat, Facebook, and surf, you should read on.The Samsung Chromebook is very sleek, thin, and light. It is somewhat similar in form to a Macbook Air, but it's also close to a number of the new Ultrabooks. The feel in hand is very solid and doesn't seem like a $249 computer. The keyboard is very good; very solid feel and great action. If you type quickly (100+ wpm), you'll be happy to know this keyboard can keep up with you. The only better keyboard I've used in recent memory is the Air, but it's not far off.When you open the box and lift the lid it automatically starts up in under 10 seconds. This is not coming up from sleep mode. That's its boot time from a cold start. The setup process is as painless as it can be. Attach it to your wireless network and if you have a gmail account, just login and you are done. I up and reading e-mail in my account in less than 5 minutes. The last out of the box Windows experience took nearly an hour before I was through all of the setup questions, patches, and add-ons.Now that you are logged in, the simplicity of the system reveals itself. Effectively the entire Chromebook is a dedicated Chrome browser. Almost everything you do is in a Chrome browser window. There are applications included and that can be installed, but they all run inside of the Chrome framework. It is a new way to think about computing. And boy is it fast.About the speed: Wow is the best way to describe it. I dare you to find a browser that is as responsive as the Chrome broswer on ChromeOS. All running on a tiny little ARM processor. This tiny little ARM processor is what gives the Chromebook its 7+ hour run time on a single charge. In practice a lot of this depends on what you are doing. If you want to stream 7 hours of YouTube videos, you're probably going to be disappointed, but for practical all-day off the charger use, I'm seeing that performance easily. It also charges like lightening, so if you throw it on the charger for an hour at lunch, you won't need to worry about it into the evening.Back to why I am keeping the Samsung Chromebook. The device does what I need to do 95% of the time during my work day and 99% for the rest of my life. All of this in a very sleek, inexpensive, and portable package. I still have my work computer, a Lenovo i7 based monster, but it is huge, heavy, and doesn't have nearly the battery life or portability of the Chromebook. I now leave that laptop in the docking station on my desk and carry around the Chromebook and that is the computer I take home. I suppose if I was still spending the majority of my time writing C# I would need a different tool, but the Chromebook is the right tool for me.Pros and Cons?This introduces an interesting point of view. What can we really compare the Chromebook to? There is nothing else that is in it's class, so I guess I'll focus primarily on functionality.Pros:-Inexpensive (I didn't say cheap)-Light-Fast-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Con)-Very simple to setup and use-Long battery life-Good build quality-Good keyboard-Good library of add-on applications (yes, another app store)-Everything for one price (Hardware, Operating System, Storage, Office Applications)Cons:-Not a full-blown operating system-Doesn't run Mac, iOS, Windows, or Android applications...none of them, it can't-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Pro)-Some apps you know and love aren't available yet, maybe never (Netflix is one)-Not as mainstream as either full-blown computer platforms or mobile platformsI gave the Samsung Chromebook 4 stars because it's really good, but not perfect. Bottom line, this is a new device that lives somewhere between tablets and full-blown traditional computers. It is a great consumption device with a full keyboard for doing some serious work (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, e-mail, and web-based applications). I recommend that you give it a shot, I think you'll really like it.	0	9	0	0	4
Major problem. Kept shutting off. Message said Microsoft windows didn't load properly and to get help from a qualified technician. Turned it off for 2 days and when I turned it back on, it worked fine.	3	4	1	8	3
This is a good, basic laptop for everyday use. It's our second laptop with very similar specs, the other being a dell that we purchased a couple weeks ago. We homeschool and all I need these laptops to do is provide a computer for my older kids to do research, type schoolwork, and to run a couple of online math programs. The kids have added amazon instant video, iTunes, and a few other fun things for their down time. This laptop does all of that very well.It was easy for me to set up. My regular laptop is a mac and I wasn't looking forward to setting up a pc but it was surprisingly intuitive. It walked me through the setup and I had it up and running in under 20 minutes. I was able to plug in our USB external disk drive which allowed it to be used to play movies with no problem. All in all this is a good value laptop for those looking for something basic for Internet use and just a few programs.	2	0	0	1	2
Because ever since my I‚Äôve had it, my sister has been using it non-stop, and it‚Äôs currently at her house. According to her, it‚Äôs very good, high graphics to play overwatch and all that, so there.	3	7	2	8	0
After my last HP laptop died, I purchased this one. So far I have absolutely no complaints. It is much lighter than my old laptop which I really like, as well as being a bit flatter. I would certainly recommend this laptop, even though I've only had it for about 2 months.	4	7	2	9	3
This product is ridiculous. It doesn't have enough memory to download the upgrade to Window$ 10 which is it's operating system. Unbelievable! Micro$oft sells an operating system that millions of computers cannot use and brilliant Acer installs it. My two year old computer kept getting annoying messages from Micro$oft (which is another horrible story) that it could not update Window$ 10 because of a lack of memory space on the c: drive. Who knows what is vital and what is expendable? I finally decided (after zillions of annoying messages from the dreaded Micro$oft) to buy a new computer with more memory. The instant I got started on this NEW computer I got a love note from Micro$oft that I didn't have enough memory to update that horrible Window$ 10 on my NEW computer. I had just turned in on and it was already obsolete. I see a Chromebook in my future. NO more Micro$oft for me. I wouldn't even buy their stock let alone another computer with Window$ again.	2	0	0	1	2
Loved everything about this machine. Apart from the heating up above the keyboard (don't know if all laptops do that or not) 7577 met all my expectations	3	7	2	8	0
"Pros:__________- Runs Chrome and Android apps.- Beautiful screen that gives you a 2400x1600. The colors are rich, sharp, and not over saturated.- Touchscreen works very well as your figures are responsive and so far have not seen any glitches that you can find on some Hp computers.- Web surfing with numerous tabs while using Microsoft still brings a quick response time.- A beautiful device for a Netflix and basic web surfing users.- The stylus pen is responsive to the screen. don't really use it though since 90% of apps out their do not need it.- The pen as well comes with perks such as a laser pointer, magnify glass, note taking, and some others that you‚Äôre most likely going to use, if you'r a pen guy.- 720 webcam that you can‚Äôt go wrong with those hoping to use skype well.- The built-in google play app store is a cool perk to have.- Full metal body but still weights less than 3 lbs.- I found it cool that more you write on the screen the more the computer will recognize what your spelling layout is. Meaning that taking notes will be pretty common after a couple of weeks with it (I'm still sticking with typing).- Theirs a button on the bottom right corner that allows a multi-window feature. It‚Äôs a useful tool for those who want to use the fullest of their screen.- 360-degree hinges which advertise exactly as it should. A laptop and a tablet.- 4 GB RAM will make lagging obsolete for basic programming.Cons and Oks:__________- For a laptop it‚Äôs a great weight, but not for a tablet.- Apps that you use (Facebook, slack, telegram, Pinterest,) will reduce the battery life fast. Those require the use of the CPU will make it lose battery life even faster.- The pen falls out easily.- Not a sensitive mouse pad.- The keyboard is too close together as you will be pushing letters, numbers, and event the delete button in places that you didn‚Äôt plan. Barely any room between the keys.- The Bluetooth connectivity disconnects at random times. I see this when my Bluetooth mouse suddenly stops working.- You‚Äôll need external adapters if you want to hook it up to an external display.- Not every app in the google play stores is designed for this computer. I wish I could say which ones but there isn‚Äôt a limit on this issue right now.- Forget drawing on this as the lag is not great at all if the pen for drawing.- Battery life sucks as I'm getting 5 hours sometimes to ""maybe"" 8 hours (if i go into a power saver mode). This is using Microsoft office, Netflix, web surfing, music playing, etc.- Speakers suck, you‚Äôll be requiring headphones when buying this. Not much bass and at max the volume isn‚Äôt anything to brag about.- You lose your pen, you‚Äôll need to buy another one as somehow the pen that comes with it is the only pen that will work for this screen.- No backlit keyboard.- Annoying USB type-C.- Pressing the power button will take you into lock screen before powering down (which takes an extra 30 seconds). You can change this but it‚Äôs still annoying enough to put it up on the list.- The accelerometer is very sensitive when getting this. Even moving the computer from one place to another sometimes makes your screen flip upside down when you‚Äôre using it as a laptop.- Big borders around the screen makes everything feel like your watching a Imax movie from a basic television.- Lag issue does arise at random times.- PowerPoint, heavy Excel and Photoshop will start to see some lag.- Not much for gaming, even using Steam is out of the option.- Keep in mind that not all apps are trustworthy as there isn‚Äôt much of a security layout in the app world. Phones always had limits but a computer is wide open.Bottom Line:__________Their are a lot of bugs or performance issues with this computer right now. But if the updates fix these problems than watching Netflix and web surfing will be perfect for you. Under this layout, you‚Äôre going to get decent battery life, a decent response time, and be able to take it anywhere you go. Weight isn't overbearing and the image quality is spot on. For those who want entertainment and nothing more, than this is a good deal.Overall, a decent amount of apps still are unable to adapt to this computer, and is in no way a gamer laptop for those who want a little more power in a computer. It‚Äôs a 80% tablet with a 60% laptop. You can do the basic of enjoyment but nothing in the high-end range regarding CPU programs / games. I tested this computer and tried to put it through everything I can give it to Verdict: It‚Äôs a college computer where movies, web surfing, and medium software programs are all you need for the use of a computer/tablet. A lot of glitches/firmware issues but if they get fixed than you're going to please with the results.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer."	1	1	0	1	4
I am happy with this purchase and so far zero issue with it. I enjoy the red back lit keys and has the F1 through F10 keys as well. It fired up quickly. The few games I play runs great (Empyrion is one I play most). Load time was quick. The graphics very nice too. The laptop fan settings was nice to have access to set the speed. You have full control on alot of stuff from turning on or off the onboard camera, microphone, wifi, and Bluetooth. It comes with Norton Internet security although not a big fan. I will use for now. Otherwise I would buy another MSI laptop again. The company I bought it from shipped it fine and I wish they would use more packaging stuffing it it's box. I did not receive it damaged nor the boxes it was in. Updates as the weeks progress.	4	8	3	8	0
"Windows 10 updates out of the Box. Took 90 minutes for all the updates to install. The speakers and HDMI output looks great and it does the job. Plays 1080 MPEG videos to a large screen for demos. Its also super light, feels like a solid college rulled notebook.Absolutely have to upgrade the RAM to 8 GM Minimum because the memory is shared between to OS and the Intel 620 Graphics. Get is now its very inexpensive and easy to upgrade.Pro Tip it shares the same 45W power supply as larger HP 17.3"" laptops. So switching it from desknti desk is easy is an open office plan."	3	4	1	8	3
8/31/2017 . . . I had to reset this HP to to factory settings today. Since this laptop was delivered July 19, 2017, I have encountered more and more slow responses, freezes, and blue screens of death. For Windows 10, it's a much lighter shade of blue than it used to be. Very frustrating. Wasted lots of time dealing with what the HP analysis tools reported as Windows 10 failures and problems with the partitions it created. Equipment checked out according to the HP analysis program, but it has been behaving suspiciously like the hard drive failure on the Dell this one replaced, I' beginning to discover there are no reliable hard drives or virtual drives. They WILL fail. HP seems to have problems accommodating Windows 10, as do ALL anti-virus programs. Nothing good for my computers on which I installed Windows 10.ORIGINAL REVIEW:My observations after 3 days:RUNS COOL! No overheating problems so far.Nice screen resolution with responsive touch screen.Camera seemed grainy, could have been lighting.Keyboard is OK (After all, it is a laptop)Touch pad is weird. Will require retraining your finger/thumb muscles. Although it does have left click and right click buttons, they are UNDERNEATH the touch pad, so at first, you'll occasionally click on the wrong thing. The cursor will move if you don't hit the buttons dead on. Not that bad, just different. I got used to it fairly quickly.Updates didn't take long . . . maybe an hour or two.6 GB RAM is adequate, but seemed odd to me. Why not build evenly? Max 16GB. Holds 2 X 8 GB memory sticks.DDR4 Memory. Description lists DDR4, but additional Information shows DDR3. It really is DDR4..The 2.4 GHz CPU speed is good, especially for a computer under $500.00; it is NOT slow.Haven't put much stress on the processor yet, so can't tell how it will perform in the long run.Used laptop without the charger for about 6 hours (mostly online w/ minimal disk use) before warning appeared that only 20% battery life remained.It runs Windows 10, and to create a recovery drive you must use a USB flash drive. It took up 8.6 GB on a 32 GB USB 2.0 drive. Probably need at least 16 GB drive to be safe. I used USB 2.0 rather than 3.0. It was cheap and took minutes, not hours. (May encounter errors first few attempts, but keep trying. Third time was a charm for me.) I still miss Windows 7 and computers that came with manuals & system CDs.The hard drive storage capacity of 1 TB is probably more than you can use before it eventually fails. The life of a USB drive is not that predictable either, but if only used for the recovery drive and written to only occasionally, it should outlast the hard drive by years.If computer develops problems, I'll revise this review.So far, I have been pleased with this purchase.	3	4	1	8	3
I'm a software engineer. I take excellent care of my computers; shut them down when not in use; keep them very clean. No food or drink near them. I have laptops from 10+ years ago that still work (yes, I actually still use them). This Dell is terrible.- Purchased June 2017.- Broke December 2017. Would not power on. Sent in to Dell for repairs; they said it had a defective motherboard board. Fixed it under warranty.- Broke again April 2018. Same problem as before.Now I'm forced to buy an extended warranty because I have a laptop that breaks every 5 months. I guess that's one way to many money... Thanks, Dell.The good:Very fast (when it actually turns on). Nice graphics.The bad:The keyboard is garbage. I thought it would just need to be broken in. However, even after 10 months, some keys are still very stiff. If you don't push the keys just right, it won't register. Not good for fast pace gaming. For example, trying to push W to move forward and nothing happens...	3	7	3	3	0
"My honest review of MSI gaming laptop after 7 days.NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti is amazing.Every high-end game which I played runs very smooth.The laptop is very thin and light as compared to others.15.6"" Full HD screen is a heaven.Keypad is of perfect size for longer gaming intervals.Windows 10 is far better than Ios. Go for it.Use code to get discount on purchase. Go to:bit.do/ amazon-store"	3	7	2	8	0
Everything about this laptop is nice, except the keyboard. I normally type pretty fast, but on this keyboard if I type quickly it drops keys or even transposes keystrokes. Many times the shift key doesn't work. The only way the keyboard works correctly is if I type slowly and deliberately, which is ridiculous. I bought a cheap Amazon Basics USB keyboard and everything is fine now, but the laptop itself is worthless without a functioning keyboard!	3	9	2	8	3
